**Introduction**

Kholinar besieged by Fused

and the Everstorm.

Scholars of the cosmere,

```
Roshar is a domineering, majestic tempest of a planet. Uniquely
shaped by three Shards, it exhibits characteristics of Odium, Honor,
and Cultivation. The inherent conflict between the three Shards’
powers has led to a cycle of destruction and war, but it has also
strengthened the people and beasts who manage to survive in this
inhospitable world.
Roshar’s indigenous people—the singers—hum to the world’s
rhythms, and they change their forms to embody new roles as they
face and pose perilous threats. Humans, who came to Roshar long
ago, abuse and subjugate one another and the singers, guided by
avarice and an unseen hand of hatred. All the while, heavily Invested
highstorms sweep across its singular continent, renewing the land
while destroying those who do not heed them. The parched terrain
awakens after each storm, as vines unfurl and greatshells emerge.
If you visit, pack a coat; though ineffectual against the murderous
highstorms, you’ll need it for your hike down from the Horneater
Peaks. Be especially prudent during your time here, for the True
Desolation grows more dire by the day. If Odium is permitted to
consume this world, his hunger will not be sated. He will continue
his ravenous conquest across the cosmere until there is nothing left.
The only way to stop such barbarous enmity is with unity—something
in short supply among the locals who have turned on each other as
the global war against Odium’s forces intensifies.
The fate of the cosmere itself hangs in the balance. Refer to my
research within these pages to guide your way. There are heroes here,
the Knights Radiant. Though they have failed many times before,
their failures hold the answer to deliverance—if they are humble
and valiant enough to see the storm through.

## Using This Book

```
The Stormlight World Guide is a companion to the
Cosmere RPG’s Stormlight Handbook. If you’re a
game master, you can use the information within these
chapters to set games nearly anywhere on Roshar—
whether in the Physical or Cognitive Realms—and
to challenge your players with dynamic adversaries.
If you’re a player, you can use the information about
nations and cultures to add depth to your character’s
backstory, then use the accounts of historical events to
form goals that drive their heroic adventures. Even if
you aren’t currently playing the Cosmere RPG, any fan
of the Stormlight Archive can enjoy the collected lore
and new insights offered in this richly illustrated guide
to Roshar.
The information in this book is divided into the
following sections:
Introduction. This provides an overview of this book
and a few basics about the cosmere.
Chapter 1: The World. This delves into the ecology and
magic of Roshar with information on the world’s flora
and fauna, highstorms, and Stormlight.
Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures. This presents
information about key civilizations of Roshar,
including important cultural, military, economic, and
political touchpoints.
Chapter 3: Cosmology and Religion. This explains
the world’s deities, other sources of extraordinary
power, and how organized religions interpret and
worship them.
Chapter 4: History of Roshar. This details major
world events from ancient times through the True
Desolation, including an examination of false historical
accounts and the rediscovered truths behind them.
Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations. This introduces
key characters from the novels, suggesting how to
incorporate them into games and how to reward player
characters who ally with them.
Chapter 6: Points of Interest. This describes some
of the richest campaign locales on Roshar, including
regional details, adventure hooks, and inspiration
for scenes.
Chapter 7: Shadesmar. This supports adventures in
the Cognitive Realm, describing its unique terrain,
inhabitants, and dangers.
Chapter 8: Adversaries and Bestiary. This presents
profiles for many creatures who inhabit Roshar,
including stat blocks the game master can use to
challenge or aid player characters.
Appendix A: Pronunciation Guide. This presents
important Rosharan terms and their pronunciations.
```

```
Appendix B: Stat Block Index. This presents an
alphabetical list of stat blocks and their page numbers.
Appendix C: Index of Terms. This provides
page references for where you can find important
information about major terms.
```

```
Events From the Novels
This book encompasses the first five Stormlight Archive
novels and includes spoilers for those books. Unless
otherwise specified, each chapter describes the world
as it exists during the year following Oathbringer , as
Radiants return and Odium’s forces spread across
Roshar. The events of Rhythm of War and Wind and
Tr u th are primarily covered in chapter 4 and in sidebars
within other chapters.
```

## About the Cosmere

```
A description of the cosmere would fill endless libraries,
but since you’re reading this manuscript, surely your
people know much of it already. In short, the cosmere
encompasses everything that exists. All the worlds,
realms, powers, and peoples find their place somewhere
within the cosmere. (See chapter 3 for information on
Roshar’s place in the greater cosmere.)
```

```
Investiture
Investiture is the indestructible energy suffusing
everything that exists across all worlds. All Investiture
derives from Adonalsium, the very power of creation
(see “Adonalsium” in chapter 3).
Though Investiture flows through all living things,
some creatures are Invested—specially empowered with
a greater concentration of this energy. A few Invested
creatures can even pour a measure of their power into
an object, causing it to become Invested and gain
unique properties.
```

```
Adapting the Stormlight Archive
In adapting the Stormlight Archive into a tabletop role-
playing game, great care was taken to remain faithful to
Roshar and the cosmere. New lore and powers described
in this game are canonical, developed in close partnership
with Brandon Sanderson. However, a few adjustments
were made to fit the medium of this collaborative game.
For example, some flexible Radiant powers have been
codified into specific mechanical effects; some words
are capitalized differently for clarity; and some lore is
merely hinted at, preserving surprises for new readers
of the novels. This game is simply a foundation to build
on, so choose whichever elements work for you—you’re
embarking on adventures in your Roshar now.
```

**2** Introduction

```
ANTHONY AVON
```

```
A person needn’t understand Investiture, nor even
know it exists, to wield its power. Investiture manifests
differently across the worlds, and its substance changes
across the Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual Realms
as well. On the world of Roshar, Investiture primarily
manifests as the luminescent vapor known as Stormlight
(see “Stormlight” in chapter 1).
```

```
Shards and Splinters
Roshar has been shaped by three Shards: Cultivation,
Honor, and Odium. These Shards are fragments of
divinity whom most mortals regard as gods. When a
Shard is divided (either willingly or unwillingly), it
Splinters into even smaller pieces; the spren of Roshar
are one example of Splinters. For more details on Shards
and Splinters, see “Shards of Adonalsium” in chapter 3.
```

```
The Three Realms
All that exists across all the worlds does so in three
realms: the Physical, the Cognitive, and the Spiritual.
Mortal minds struggle to grasp this, but the realms
can be conceptualized as if the Physical Realm were
the body, the Cognitive Realm were the mind, and
the Spiritual Realm were the soul.
```

```
Physical Realm
The Physical Realm is the realm of the tangible aspects
of reality, home to particles, mass, and planets. This
realm is what mortals most readily think of as reality.
```

```
Cognitive Realm
The Cognitive Realm is the realm of thought, home
to the cognitive aspects of living and non-living things.
It can give form to the sheer concepts of things, even
those from the Spiritual Realm which are normally
without form. Often called Shadesmar, the Cognitive
Realm is discussed in more detail in chapter 7.
Spiritual Realm
The Spiritual Realm is the timeless realm of the
essence of things, home to concepts like Identity and
Connection. Though this realm is outside space and
time, everything that exists has a Spiritual aspect.
Regardless of how these aspects manifest in the other
realms, in the Spiritual they hold their truest form.
```

```
Perpendicularities
While the three realms are usually separate, it’s possible
to bend them into a junction—generally in an area with
enormous Investiture—forming a perpendicularity that
allows travel between realms. Most perpendicularities
are created by Shards.

## chapter 1

## The World

```
Measuring Time
The Rosharan year contains five hundred days, and its
end is marked by the first two weeks of the Weeping.
The Singer Rhythm of Peace
Singers measure the passage of time intuitively by
attuning to the Rhythm of Peace, a planetary rhythm
that continually revolves for those able to hear it. Its
gentle beats vary in layered cycles. The first cycle is
tied to the pure tones of Roshar itself. The second cycle
syncs with the Lull, a weather phenomenon that occurs
every five hundred days. The third cycle accounts for
the positions of the three moons as they orbit once a day.
Ever-present but subtle, the Rhythm of Peace easily
fades into the background. A singer who concentrates
on it for a stanza—listening for the intensity of beats and
the space between—can determine the current period of
the three cycles, and thus, the current date and time.
The Human Calendar
The humans of Roshar divide each year into ten
months, each month into ten weeks, and each week
into five days. The Rosharan day is twenty hours long;
the sun rises at the fifth hour and sets at the fifteenth
(see “The Planet Roshar” in chapter 3).
In eastern Roshar, the the human calendar’s months,
weeks, and days are named after the Vorin faith’s
numbering system (which is unsurprisingly named after
the faith’s revered Heralds): Jes, Nan, Chach, Vev, Palah,
Shash, Betab, Kak, Tanat, and Ishi. Adding a series of
suffixes to these numbers indicates the current date.
Dates are written in glyphs in order of year, month,
week, and day, with each number separated by periods.
For example, the third day of Ishi during the month of
Ishi in the year 1173 would be written as 1173.10.10.3.
The Weeping
The last two weeks of each Rosharan year usher in what
humans call the Weeping, while listeners call it the
Lull. This steady rain continues almost ceaselessly for
four weeks, interrupted only by Lightday—marking the
Rosharan new year—which brings weather of its own.
In even-numbered years, Lightday is a clear day, but in
odd-numbered years, it brings a highstorm. After this,
the Weeping resumes for another two weeks.
Midpeace
Halfway through the year, at the midpoint between
Weepings, lies a four-week period with no highstorms.

```
eset by an endless cycle of violent storms
and populated by fragments of the power of
creation, Roshar is a world shaped by divine
mathematics and concentrated Investiture. This
chapter provides an overview of Roshar—perilous but
uniquely beautiful, imbued with fascinating magic, and
full of remarkable lifeforms.
```

## Roshar’s Ecosystem

```
On Roshar, highstorms and spren interconnect all life.
The world’s native flora and fauna flourish despite—
and even because of—the severe weather, having
evolved remarkable protections such as protective shells
and carapaces. The highstorms deposit nutrient-filled
sediment that sustains Rosharan creatures, nurturing
the gemhearts within and enabling the creatures to
form symbiotic bonds with spren (see “Spren” later in
this chapter). And so the fauna thrives and the spren
brush the Physical Realm.
```

## Culture on Roshar

```
Several sapient species inhabit Roshar, most notably
singers and humans.
Singers are indigenous to the world. With their
carapace armor and their ability to transform their
bodies into useful forms by bonding with spren, singers
are naturally adapted to Roshar’s climate, terrain, and
other native lifeforms. For more details on singers,
see “Singers and Listeners” in chapter 2.
Humans evolved in very different circumstances
before migrating to Roshar, so they aren’t as well suited
for its environment. They colonized the regions that
were most compatible with their species, then, as their
conquest continued, the humans learned to shelter from
challenging conditions.
```

ANTHONY AVON

Currency

Due to both their beauty and usefulness, gemstones
are a common currency on Roshar. However, there’s
no universally recognized system for currency across
all nations.
The listeners collect and use gems as a community,
harvesting gemhearts to use in farming. By drumming
the Rhythm of Cultivation in the presence of crops,
listeners prompt lifespren to transfer Stormlight from
infused gems into growing plants. While listeners
frequently adorn themselves with uncut gems, they
don’t use them as currency. Instead, listeners barter
with goods and services, reserving a portion of each
family’s resources to support children and those who
can’t work.
Most human-ruled nations use spheres—pieces of
gems encased in glass beads—as their primary currency.
Unencased gems can also be used as currency in some
places, with an upcharge for being more difficult to
authenticate.

```
Spheres
Each glass sphere is roughly the size of a human
thumbnail, with one side slightly flattened to prevent
the sphere from rolling away. The monetary value
of a sphere is determined by the size and type of the
gemstone encased inside.
These spheres are prized in part for each gem’s
ability to store a small quantity of Stormlight (see
the upcoming “Stormlight” section). When infused,
these lit gems are further enhanced by their glass
encasements. Many people prefer infused spheres over
dun spheres—those without Light—as the Stormlight
easily proves the currency is real.
Denominations
Regardless of gem type, spheres have three denomin-
ations (from the smallest gem to largest): chips, marks,
and broams. One mark equals five chips, and one broam
equals four marks or twenty chips.
Gem Types
In addition to denomination, gem types vary in
monetary value, determined by their relative value
in Soulcasting. Diamond spheres are the least valuable;
for simplicity when discussing item value, this game
expresses all Rosharan prices in diamond marks
(also known as clearmarks).
Rather than each gemstone having a unique value,
they’re instead categorized into tiers. The Sphere
Values table lists the five tiers of gemstones and their
values compared to diamond marks.
```

## Highstorms and Stormlight

```
The highstorm, a weather phenomenon unique to
Roshar, has irrevocably shaped the world and its flora
and fauna. Human and singer cultures are heavily
influenced by highstorms; this is due in part to the
danger they pose, but more importantly, these storms
have long been the primary source of Investiture (in the
form of Stormlight) on Roshar.
```

```
Highstorms
A highstorm is an immense hurricane that continually
travels Roshar, but unlike the storms on many other
worlds, highstorms are powerfully Invested. Singers
can seek transformations during them, and the humans
of Roshar depend on these storms to replenish the
Stormlight in their spheres.
As each highstorm moves east to west across the
continent, it gradually decreases in strength. By the time
a highstorm passes over the Misted Mountains east of
Shinovar, it’s indistinguishable from a regular storm.
Properties
A highstorm’s arrival is marked by gray skies, burgeon-
ing winds, and dense, humid air. Once it nears, it
appears as a flood of rain on the horizon with thick
black clouds lit by flashes of lightning.
As a highstorm passes overhead, it goes through
three stages. Its front—called the stormwall—is a
visible shroud carrying tempestuous winds, destructive
debris, and torrential rain. This stormwall is generally
considered the most dangerous part of a highstorm.
The storm’s main body isn’t as deadly as the stormwall,
as it carries less debris, but the winds remain powerful
enough to hurl large objects such as loose boulders.
The end of a highstorm—known as the riddens—
is characterized by light rain and mild winds.
```

```
Origin
Many humans and singers believe highstorms form
at the so-called Origin of Storms, a location far to
the east of the Rosharan continent. This Origin’s
existence is questionable; many stories tell of people
who sailed to find it, but either failed in their quest or
never returned. Despite these ancient myths, modern
stormwardens believe there’s only a single highstorm
that circles Roshar, rather than many originating from
a legendary Origin.
```

```
Crem
In eastern Roshar, where hardy plants cling directly to
storm-scoured stone, soil doesn’t exist. However, crem
plays a similar role in the ecosystem. This light-brown
sediment accumulates on surfaces during highstorms,
and unless cleaned, crem covers and inevitably buries
exposed objects. As a result, some scholars use crem’s
layers to help date discoveries, though this technique
is less reliable in regions where crem builds unevenly.
Crem provides the necessary nutrients for Roshar’s
native life. Flora use it to reinforce natural defenses
against highstorms, while creatures with gemhearts
(including singers) grow them by drinking cremwater.
Crem serves many more purposes for humans and
singers. For humans, it offers fertilizer for farming and
sealant to deter pests from fields. Crem can also be
filtered from rainwater and shaped like clay, and both
singers and humans utilize it as a building material.
Humans create bricks from it and use it for insulation,
while listeners shape rough clay into simple buildings
that can easily be rebuilt as needed.
```

```
Cultural Impact
Highstorms have directly influenced the evolution
of singer and human culture on Roshar. For singers,
highstorms offer the potential for transformation.
While venturing into one is dangerous, singers’ bodies
can typically withstand the onslaught of elements.
While in a highstorm, a singer can attract and bond a
spren by having the right mindset for the desired type
of spren; when they do, the bonded spren grants them
a certain form. Singer forms serve many specialized
purposes, from allowing for reproduction to optimizing
for combat. This process holds much significance for
singers, especially as they prepare for a new phase in
their lives.
Humans, however, have no chance of surviving a
highstorm without shelter. They construct buildings
with a defensible eastern (or stormward) side, and
on the western (or leeward) side, they place fragile
architecture elements such as windows or balconies.
Humans prefer to establish settlements in locations with
natural protections against highstorms, but if that’s not
an option, they create windbreaks and similar defensive
structures to serve instead.
```

```
Chapter 1: The World 7
```

```
Other human adaptations to highstorms include
creating storm cisterns to filter clean drinking water,
building storm shelters to comfortably wait out
highstorms, and adopting sanitation practices to prevent
refuse from being swept from one town to another.
The prevalence of highstorms has influenced human
and singer language. Humans frequently invoke storms
as curses to express frustration or anger (for example,
“Storm it!” “Storms take you!” and “Storming man!”).
Singers tend to speak more positively of storms,
referencing them not as something to be avoided or
loathed, but revered for the change they bring. Singer
language also refers to storms more casually, such
as using “stormpause” to refer to the time between
highstorms.
Stormwardens
Stormwardens are human scholars who predict
highstorms using mathematics and a glyph-based
script. The Vorin church frowns on stormwardens both
for predicting the future and for allowing men to read
and write. Despite this, stormwardens are undeniably
useful; even some devout Vorins tolerate their presence,
and stormwardens often work for governments and
military officers.
```

```
The Everstorm
For millennia, life on Roshar coexisted with continent-
wide storms, long ago adapting to the consistency of
east-to-west highstorms.
However, at the end of the Era of Solitude, the
Everstorm was summoned (see “True Desolation” in
chapter 4), and it remains an active threat on Roshar
today. Because this unnatural storm travels west to
east, the humans’ protections and precautions against
the highstorms proved insufficient, and the Everstorm’s
initial arrival caused untold chaos and destruction.
```

```
Properties
The Everstorm is Invested and driven by Odium
(see “Roshar’s Three Shards” in chapter 3). This storm
is characterized by its black clouds and red lightning.
It lacks some properties of a highstorm—it has no
stormwall and carries no crem—but its violent winds,
lightning, and debris can be just as destructive. The
Everstorm typically appears every nine days, though
Odium can exert direct control over the speed of the
storm, either hastening its passage across Roshar or
slowing it to a standstill.
```

```
The stormwall approached....
It was a massive wave of water,
dirt, and rocks, hundreds of feet
high, thousands upon thousands
of windspren zipping before it.
```

**8** Chapter 1: The World

```
STEPHEN NAJARIAN
```

```
The strange red lightning didn’t
merely set fires or scorch the ground;
it could break through rock, causing
blasts of fragmenting stone.
```

```
When the Everstorm appeared, its most dramatic
effect was freeing the many singers whose identities and
agency had been stolen, restoring their ability to hear
and attune the rhythms (see “Singers and Listeners”
in chapter 2).
Within the Everstorm, the Fused—ancient, powerful
singers—can be reborn through claiming the bodies of
singers who sacrifice their own lives in the process.
```

```
Stormlight
Stormlight, the main form of Investiture on Roshar,
is regularly recharged by the continual passing of
highstorms.
Properties
When not contained, Stormlight appears and behaves
much like luminescent white smoke. Humans and
singers can gather Stormlight by leaving out dun gems
before a highstorm; when the gems are exposed to the
storm, Stormlight infuses them, and the gems glow
with its contained power.
Stormlight gradually leaks from most containers
it’s held in—including from a Surgebinder, a person
infused with its power. People can only hold Stormlight
for minutes, spheres can hold it for days, and larger
gemstones can hold it for longer still. While rare,
perfect gemstones can hold Stormlight indefinitely.
```

```
Mundane Uses
As a renewable resource, Stormlight serves many
purposes. The people of Roshar use infused spheres
as their primary light source, gathering these gems
in lanterns and light fixtures to provide steady
illumination. Fabrials—marvelous devices powered
by Stormlight—can only operate if their component
gems are infused.
Singers also use rhythms alongside Stormlight-
infused gemstones to encourage the growth of crops.
Surgebinding Uses
Surgebinders are people who fuel their abilities with
Stormlight. They acquire Stormlight by breathing
it in; this usually comes from a limited supply provided
by their infused gemstones, but Surgebinders can
continually renew Stormlight while near a highstorm
or perpendicularity. The “Surgebinding” section later
in this chapter describes the powers wielded through
Surgebinding.

As with all of Roshar’s native life, the world’s beautifully
resilient flora has adapted to survive the constant
highstorms and desolate environment.
```

```
Common Characteristics
Vegetation typically grows on the western side of
geographical landmarks, such as hills or valleys, where
it’s sheltered from the worst of a highstorm’s winds.
Most plants have also developed defensive shells; when
they detect nearby movement or an incoming highstorm,
these plants withdraw their vulnerable structures into
their shells until danger passes.
The people of Roshar have learned to cultivate
flora that doesn’t retract as readily. Combined with
techniques to control plant growth, gardeners can create
stunning ornamental gardens or individual houseplants.
Regional Distinctions
On the eastern edge of the continent, where highstorms
are at their most powerful, most plants grow in heavily
sheltered areas called laits. However, a few hardy plants
sprout on open ground, including species like knobweed
that rely on highstorm winds to spread their seeds.
On the western side of the continent, where
highstorms are much less brutal, vegetation is less
sensitive and retracts into its shell slowly, or not at all.
```

```
Types of Flora
Though most Rosharan flora shares many basic
characteristics, the variety of plant life reflects the
world’s diversity and uniqueness.
```

```
Rockbuds
The Rosharan term rockbud refers to both a specific
plant (known as the true rockbud or common rockbud),
as well as to many plant species possessing a rocklike
outer shell. Many of these species can grow to the size
of a barrel.
To grow their shells, rockbuds draw minerals from
cremwater and the environment. Rockbuds that root on
stone structures must be diligently removed, lest they
eat away at the stone and compromise it.
Shalebark
This unusual lifeform is classified as flora by Rosharan
scholars, but in truth, shalebark is formed by an animal
that lives within its rocklike protective exterior.
Shalebark takes on a fascinating variety of vivid
colors and visually interesting shapes—from flat and
folded to bulbous and knobby. Some types of shalebark
have symbiotic relationships with snails and cremlings:
These creatures clean moss and lichen off the shalebark,
and, in turn, they’re camouflaged from predators.
Humans and singers cultivate shalebark as both
ornamental plants and architectural elements.

Trees
Like other plants, the trees of Roshar have evolved
to withstand their environment. The stone-barked
Dalewillows have long fronds that twist in the wind.
Jella trees absorb crem to reinforce their wooden trunks
and branches (whose red needle-like leaves retract for
protection); the crem lends these trees a distinctive
light-brown coloration and rocky texture. Makam
trees produce a strong but lightweight wood, valued for
constructing structures like the mobile bridges of the
Alethi warcamps.
```

```
Crops
Staple crops of Roshar include lavis, tallew, and clema.
These labor-intensive grains are farmed across Roshar.
Clema is used to make the granular clemabread. Tallew
can be stored for months, making it useful for rations,
and it’s often prepared by either boiling or steaming and
adding spices. Lavis grains are crushed and combined
with spices to create kuma or steamed as a side dish.
Both tallew and lavis can also be fermented or distilled
into alcoholic drinks.
Medicinal Plants
Some Rosharan flora has medicinal properties.
Chapter 7 of the Stormlight Handbook describes the
mechanical effects of the following, and chapter 
provides guidance on using Survival to forage for
resources.
Bitterleaf. Used as a treatment for epileptic seizures,
bitterleaf can be steeped as a daily tea, but it’s most
efficacious when chewed.
Bloodivy. Named for its crimson color, bloodivy can
be dried and ground to support the immune system
and act as an expectorant for phlegm. It’s used to
treat the grindings, a respiratory virus that causes a
severe cough.
Fathom Bark. The bark of the fathom tree has powerful
anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.
A large dose can reduce cranial swelling. It can be
administered by chewing, or it can be prepared for
topical use by boiling until soft then grinding it into a
paste. Some people use fathom bark recreationally for
its relaxant properties.
Fourleaf. Expensive but effective, the sap of the fourleaf
plant wards off infection and rotspren. It’s most
potent when harvested directly after the Weeping.
The four sections of the plant’s leaves separate after
repeated exposure to cremless water, giving it a
distinctive shape.
```

```
Knobweed. The knobweed is a common reed that grows
on the leeward side of boulders. It contains drops of a
milky-white sap that is a potent antiseptic. This reed
is easy to forage if one knows what to look for, but
the extraction process is tedious.
Lister’s Oil. Choice above most other antiseptics,
lister’s oil has a long shelf life and works quickly
and with extended efficacy. It has a peculiar odor
often associated with hospitals, and it requires a
long curing period before it’s ready for use.
Winterwort. Used as an anesthetic, winterwort is
a bitter, bulbous root that can be crushed into a
powder and mixed with oil for easier ingestion.
Surgeons use high doses to induce sleep or
maintain unconsciousness during surgery.
Hazardous Plants
Roshar is also home to several varieties of plants
with toxic or deadly properties. Singers and humans
with distant singer ancestry (such as members of the
Herdazian and Unkalaki ethnic groups) are more
resistant to the effects of such plants.
Firemoss. Red-brown in color, firemoss can
spontaneously combust once dried. The plant can
be used medicinally as an anesthetic, but it’s a highly
addictive substance and most surgeons use it only as
a last resort. When rubbed between the thumb and
forefinger, firemoss produces a smoke that can be
inhaled to induce euphoria and altered perception.
The more it’s used, the less effective it is, increasing
the risk of addiction.
Blackbane. One of the deadliest natural poisons on
Roshar, blackbane has narrow, dark-green leaves split
into three points at their tips. The longer these leaves
are dried, the more potent their poison becomes.
```

```
Non-Native Plants
Due to the Shinovar region’s unusually mild highstorms,
its flora never adapted to harsh conditions, and its
ecology varies dramatically from the rest of Roshar.
Most of Shinovar’s plant life isn’t native to Roshar;
it descended from plants brought by the human
refugees from Ashyn (see “Ashyn Expulsion” in
chapter 4).
Unlike the rest of Roshar, Shinovar’s ground
is comprised of soil. Plants that don’t retreat from
movement, such as grass, can flourish there. Shin
farmers cultivate crops including wheat, strawberries,
and grapes.
```

**12** Chapter 1: The World

## Fauna.

```
Beyond humans and singers, Roshar supports many
types of diverse fauna. In addition to Roshar’s native
crustaceous species, some creatures from other worlds
have adapted to Roshar’s severe conditions.
```

```
Common Characteristics
To weather highstorms, most of Roshar’s native fauna
have outer shells or carapaces. These crustaceans also
naturally grow gemhearts; the larger the animal, the
larger this gem that forms within them. Gemhearts
allow certain species to form symbiotic relationships
with spren. Large gemhearts are prized (and hunted)
by humans, who use them as currency and for
Soulcasting.
The animals of Roshar have the potential to
develop sapience, and several have done so, including
the santhidyn, Tai-na, chasmfiends, larkin, and
Ryshadium horses. This potential has been amplified
by Cultivation’s presence on Roshar (see “Roshar’s
Three Shards” in chapter 3).
```

```
Types of Fauna
Creatures on Roshar range from awe-inspiring to
menacing, many of them both in equal measure.
```

```
Greatshells
Roshar’s crustaceous megafauna are referred to as
greatshells. This classification encompasses both aquatic
and terrestrial species. Greatshells generally have small
populations and require one or more stages of pupation
to fully mature. Due to their size, greatshells have the
largest gemhearts, and humans have hunted some
species to extinction.
Greatshells can form symbiotic bonds with luckspren.
Without these bonds, the largest greatshells would be
unable to move and their own weight would crush them.
The chasmfiend is one of Roshar’s most infamous
greatshells. This predatory species makes its home
within the chasms of the Shattered Plains.
The Tai-na, the largest greatshells on Roshar, are
island-sized creatures native to the Reshi Sea. Their
shells support entire jungle ecosystems; trees take root
on their carapace and rockbuds grow from the tops of
their heads. Tai-na are worshipped as gods by the Reshi,
```

```
Chapter 1: The World 13
```

ROMAIN KURDI

```
who establish communities on their backs. Notably, the
Reshi believe these greatshells to be sapient due to the
Tai-na’s bonds with remarkable spren.
Other greatshells include the semi-aquatic yu-nerig
(found along Roshar’s northern coastline) and the now-
extinct lanceryn (native to the islands of Aimia).
Other Shelled Creatures
Beyond greatshells, most of Roshar’s native fauna are
smaller species with hard shells or flexible carapaces.
Numerous species of tiny scavengers are commonly
grouped together as cremlings. Viewed as pests,
cremlings often eat anything from plants and carrion
to live prey.
Many larger crustacean species are domesticated or
even viewed as pets. Chulls are large, shelled animals
often used for pulling caravans and other hard labor.
Gumfrem are domesticated pasture animals raised for
their gemhearts, which are used to Soulcast meat.
Other wild creatures can be found in different regions
of Roshar. Whitespines are cunning, deadly, and highly
mobile predators. Axehinds are lean, quadrupedal
herbivores with minimal carapace; though hunted for
their meat, they prove difficult to catch due to their
skittish demeanor and quick, powerful leaps.
```

```
Non-Shelled Creatures
Though rare compared to crustaceous creatures, a few
native Rosharan species don’t have shells or carapaces.
These include a variety of aquatic species (such as
freshwater and saltwater fish), along with several
terrestrial species.
Axehounds are predatory pack animals, but humans
have domesticated them as household pets. Skyeels are
flying animals who dwell near coastal regions; thanks
to natural camouflage on their backs and underbellies,
skyeels can hide from predators both above and below.
Lurgs are fist-sized amphibians whose cocoons dissolve
during rainstorms, signaling them to hunt insects;
children often pester lurgs by pouring water on their
cocoons, tricking the creatures into jumping around
in search of food.
```

```
Non-Native Fauna
Most non-native creatures live in Shinovar due to
its unique ecology. Like Shinovar’s flora, most of the
region’s fauna is descended from the animals brought
by the human refugees from Ashyn (see “Ashyn
Expulsion” in chapter 4). However, a few non-native
species can survive on the eastern side of the continent.
```

```

```

**14** Chapter 1: The World

```
TOM BABBEY
```

Among these are horses, which are used widely as far
as Alethkar and the warcamps on the Shattered Plains.
Most mammals don’t fare well on Roshar unless
domesticated, but hogs, rats, and minks stubbornly
persist in the wild. Hogs are the most common source
of non-Soulcast meat. Rats are pests who are often
referenced in insults. Minks are scavengers who skulk
in the shadows to survive.
Several bird species exist on Roshar, though they fare
poorly in the wild and require domestication to thrive.
Most human cultures refer to birds, no matter their
species, as chickens.

## Spren

Spren are Splinters of Investiture, though they pale
in comparison to the vastly powerful Shards they came
from (see “Shards of Adonalsium” in chapter 3). These
fragments of creation personify concepts, and some
can even gain sapience through Connection to sapient
creatures.

Characteristics

Vast in number throughout Roshar, spren greatly
vary in appearance, features, and intelligence. Many
appear instinctively in the Physical Realm in response
to emotions or natural phenomena. Others can change
their shape, mimic voices, and choose which people they
are visible to. Radiant spren are intelligent and form
their own societies in the Cognitive Realm.
Spren feel pain but are difficult to kill. When a
Radiant with a strong spren bond breaks their oaths
(see “Knights Radiant” in chapter 4), their bonded
spren is deeply traumatized and becomes a deadeye.
Spren can also be permanently killed using anti-Light
(see the upcoming “Science and Technology” section).

Types of Spren

Spren fall into several categories: lesser spren, Radiant
spren, unique spren, Voidspren, and corrupted spren.

Lesser Spren
Most spren are non-sapient and manifest naturally
on Roshar. These lesser spren, sometimes known as
subspren, become visible in the Physical Realm in
response to a certain stimulus. A few lesser spren are
visible in their entirety in the Physical Realm, but most
can only be fully perceived from within Shadesmar
(see “Shadesmar Spren” in chapter 7). Lesser spren
can be subdivided into two types: emotion spren and
nature spren.

```
Emotion Spren
Emotion spren gravitate to intense feelings such as
anger, fear, and joy. However, they’re rare in crowds,
even amid heightened emotions. Common types of
emotion spren include the following:
Angerspren manifest as pools of boiling blood near
an enraged person’s feet.
Anticipationspren look like red streamers emerging
from the ground near people who are awaiting
something.
Beautyspren appear as golden sparkles that glisten near
a person who is particularly taken with someone or
something’s beauty, possibly even their own.
Exhaustionspren look like jets of brown dust erupting
near a weary person.
Fearspren manifest as small globs of purple goo
emerging around a fearful person.
Gloryspren appear as translucent golden orbs around
those experiencing great triumph.
Joyspren rarely manifest, but they occasionally appear as
blue leaves circling someone expressing jubilation.
Painspren swarm a person in pain, appearing as orange
hands grasping at the injury.
Shamespren look like red and white petals falling to
the ground beside an ashamed person.
Shockspren appear as pale-yellow triangles that break
like glass around an alarmed person.
```

```
Nature Spren
Nature spren appear near phenomena such as fire,
rain, and decay. Common types of nature spren include
the following:
Coldspren grow like spikes around frigid objects
and creatures.
Decayspren look like barnacles gathered on dilapidated
objects and rotting food.
Flamespren manifest as small figures of light whose
sizes, shapes, and brightness shift within a fire.
Lifespren appear as glowing green motes around flora,
especially after a highstorm.
Luckspren manifest around skyeels and greatshells,
and they look like small, white arrowheads.
Rainspren are most common during the Weeping and
appear as glowing blue candles topped by an eye.
Rotspren manifest as red, translucent insects around
infected wounds and rotting corpses.
Starspren are rarely seen, appearing at night as pinpricks
of light chasing each other.
Windspren usually appear as ribbons of light riding
the winds, but they can change their shape.
```

```
Chapter 1: The World 15
```

```
Radiant Spren
Radiant spren are sapient and embody higher concepts
such as honor or truth. When they enter the Physical
Realm, they lose memories and cognitive function
unless they form a Nahel bond and remain close to their
Surgebinder (see the upcoming “Surgebinding” section).
In Shadesmar, Radiant spren have humanoid forms,
but their appearances are simpler in the Physical Realm.
See “Shadesmar Spren” in chapter 7 for information
about Radiant spren societies, and see chapter 5 of the
Stormlight Handbook for more details on Radiant orders
and their spren.
The nine known types of Radiant spren include
the following:
Ashspren grant surges to Dustbringers. In the Physical
Realm, they manifest as branching cracks that burn
across surfaces or within objects. Their Shadesmar
forms have ash-white skin that crumbles to reveal
bone, then reforms.
Cultivationspren grant surges to Edgedancers. In the
Physical Realm, they manifest as vines and crystals
that sometimes resemble a humanoid face. Their
Shadesmar forms resemble humans made of tightly
woven vines with crystal hands and eyes.
Highspren grant surges to Skybreakers. In the Physical
Realm, they usually manifest as holes in the air that
reveal a dark, starry sky. Their Shadesmar forms
are humanoid silhouettes like windows to that same
starscape.
Honorspren grant surges to Windrunners. In the
Physical Realm, they usually manifest as miniature
versions of their Shadesmar selves, but they can
shapeshift at will. Their Shadesmar forms are
humanoid figures glowing softly with blue-white light
and wearing clothing made of their own essence.
Inkspren grant surges to Elsecallers. In the Physical
Realm, they manifest as their Shadesmar selves, but
they can change their size at will. Their Shadesmar
forms are inky black with an iridescent sheen, and
their clothing is formed from their body.
Liespren (or Cryptics) grant surges to Lightweavers.
In the Physical Realm, Cryptics manifest on an object
as a raised pattern that’s complex and constantly
changing. In Shadesmar, they wear geometric robes,
and their heads are impossible patterns that float above
their humanoid forms.
Lightspren (or Reachers) grant surges to Willshapers.
In the Physical Realm, Reachers manifest as comet-like
pulsing orbs of white fire. Their Shadesmar forms
look like polished bronze humanoids engraved with
unique patterns.
```

```
Mistspren grant surges to Truthwatchers. In the
Physical Realm, they manifest as reflected light. Their
Shadesmar forms are made of mist with unmoving
porcelain masks for faces; uniquely, they can take a
non-humanoid appearance.
Peakspren grant surges to Stonewards. In the Physical
Realm, they look like small stone figures. Their
Shadesmar forms are made of stone, with cracks
of molten light splitting their skin.
Unique Spren
A few spren are one of a kind. These unique spren
include the Unmade (see “The Unmade” in chapter 3),
the Iriali spren Cusicesh, and the Bondsmith spren.
Bondsmith Spren
Unlike other Surgebinders, a Bondsmith’s powers are
granted by a unique spren, rather than by a Radiant
spren. (See chapter 5 of the Stormlight Handbook
for details on Bondsmiths.) There are three known
Bondsmith spren:
The Nightwatcher. The Nightwatcher is a Splinter of
Cultivation. Unlike most spren, she’s uninfluenced
by people’s perception of her, and her behavior
reflects fewer human traits than the spren of other
Surgebinders. She appears as a vaguely humanoid-
shaped cloud of dark-green mist with a feminine face.
Those who petition her receive both a boon and a
curse through the Old Magic.
The Sibling. The Sibling is a Splinter of both Honor
and Cultivation. The Sibling manifests in the Physical
Realm as the tower city of Urithiru, including most
of its fabrials, which they can control and power with
Towerlight (see the upcoming “Light Studies” section).
The Stormfather. The Stormfather, known to listeners
as the Rider of Storms, is a Splinter of Honor. He
commands the highstorms and reportedly has spoken
to people within the stillness of a storm’s centerbeat.
He is mostly present in the Physical Realm and
manifests as an enormous face stretching across
a highstorm’s clouds.
See “Roshar’s Three Shards” in chapter 3 to learn more
about the Nightwatcher and the Stormfather.
```

```
Voidspren
Spren derived from Odium’s Investiture are Voidspren.
Unlike most spren, Voidspren retain their cognitive
functions in the Physical Realm without a Nahel bond
(see the upcoming “Surgebinding” section).
Some Voidspren serve as sapient agents of Odium,
while others are akin to lesser spren, able to bond with
singers and grant a form of power (see “Singer Forms”
in chapter 2). Certain Voidspren can make themselves
```

**16** Chapter 1: The World

```
GERVA PEREZ
```

```
Stormspren. Stormspren glow red with sparks of
lightning. When bonded to a singer’s gemheart,
they grant the Regal stormform.
Zealspren. Zealspren look like bright blue drops of
oil crackling. When bonded to a singer’s gemheart,
they grant the Regal envoyform.
```

```
Corrupted Spren
Sja-anat, one of the Unmade (see “The Unmade”
in chapter 3), can corrupt spren. When she corrupts—
or as she prefers to call it, Enlightens—a spren, they
take on a more visceral, exaggerated appearance than
their normal counterparts. For example, Enlightened
shamespren look like shards of glass, while the hands
of Enlightened painspren become elongated and
monstrous.
Though Sja-anat once only corrupted lesser spren,
she has gained the ability to corrupt Radiant spren.
An Enlightened Radiant spren who forms a Nahel
bond might grant Surgebinding effects that differ
from those of other Radiant spren.
```

```
invisible, even to those who can typically see sapient
spren. Examples of Voidspren include the following:
Blightspren. Blightspren look like small yellow puffs
of miasma. When bonded to a singer’s gemheart,
they grant the Regal decayform.
Chaosspren. Chaosspren are invisible most of the time,
but they leave trails of red sparks and lightning under
certain circumstances.
Guidespren. Guidespren look much like windspren,
though they are yellow. They can also take humanoid
shapes, appearing as tiny beings who step through
the air on pillars of yellow light.
Hastespren. Hastespren appear as torn purple insect
wings tossed through the wind. When bonded to a
singer’s gemheart, they grant the Regal relayform.
Nightspren. Legend has it that nightspren only appear
in complete darkness, leading to rampant misinform-
ation and unreliable descriptions. When bonded to a
singer’s gemheart, they grant the Regal nightform.
Secretspren. Secretspren appear as vivid yellow spheres
crackling with energy. They raise an alarm on sensing
particularly noticeable uses of Investiture, such as
fabrials and certain surges.

## Surgebinding

Surges are the fundamental forces of the cosmere. These
surges are powered by a source of Investiture, and the
manipulation of them is known as Surgebinding. Beings
and items that Surgebind are often beholden to certain
conditions, depending on how they access their power.
For singers and humans, Surgebinding is typically
made possible through a bond with a spren, the use of
a highly Invested item such as an Honorblade, or the
use of technology that combines Invested materials to
produce a certain effect. The most famous Surgebinders
on Roshar are the Knights Radiant.
While a Surgebinder is infused with Stormlight, it
grants them energy, heals physical ailments (such as
injuries and exhaustion), and can be used to fuel surges.

The Surges

There are ten surges. Every Knight Radiant has access
to two surges, bound by the oaths and strictures of
their order. Each Radiant order’s surges overlap with
that of one other Radiant order; the following surges are
organized by the Radiant orders they overlap with. (See
chapters 5 and 6 of the _Stormlight Handbook_ for more
details on the surges and Radiant orders.)

```
Adhesion
Adhesion is the surge of binding, wielded
by Bondsmiths and Windrunners.
Surgebinders with access to Adhesion can
use Full Lashings to create temporary
bonds. Although these bonds are typically
physical, Bondsmiths of the Knights
Radiant can use this surge with Spiritual
Connections.
```

```
Gravitation
Gravitation is the surge of gravitational
attraction, wielded by Windrunners and
Skybreakers. Surgebinders with access
to Gravitation can use Basic and Reverse
Lashings to change the direction or
pull of gravity for themselves and other
people or objects they infuse, granting the
ability to fly.
Division
Division is the surge of destruction,
wielded by Skybreakers and Dustbringers.
Surgebinders with access to Division
can split molecular bonds in beings and
objects, controlling their disintegration
and decay with precision.
```

```
Abrasion
Abrasion is the surge of frictional
force, wielded by Dustbringers and
Edgedancers. Surgebinders with access
to Abrasion can increase or decrease
friction between two surfaces, even
giving themselves the ability to become
frictionless and to skate.
```

```
Progression
Progression is the surge of growth,
wielded by Edgedancers and
Truthwatchers. Surgebinders with access
to Progression can control growth and
regrowth. They can use this ability to
heal and resuscitate living organisms.
Illumination
Illumination is the surge of light and
sound, wielded by Truthwatchers and
Lightweavers. Surgebinders with access
to Illumination can create visual and
auditory illusions called Lightweavings.
```

```
Transformation
Transformation is the surge of
conversion, wielded by Lightweavers
and Elsecallers. Surgebinders with
access to Transformation can Soulcast,
transforming a being or object into
one of the Ten Essences.
Transportation
Transportation is the surge of Realmatic
Transition, wielded by Elsecallers and
Willshapers. Surgebinders with access
to Transportation can travel between
the Physical and Cognitive Realms
by Elsecalling.
```

```
Cohesion
Cohesion is the surge of shaping solid
objects, wielded by Willshapers and
Stonewards. Surgebinders with access to
Cohesion can use Stoneshaping to mold
solid materials—usually stone—into
different shapes.
Tension
Tension is the surge of manipulating
rigidity, wielded by Stonewards and
Bondsmiths. Surgebinders with access
to Tension can alter the stiffness of a
substance, forging protective barriers
or flexible objects.
```

```
Chapter 1: The World 19
```

## Science and Technology

```
Roshar’s technological advancements are dominated
by the science of fabrials. These Light-powered devices
utilize gemstones and spren to perform specific tasks.
People who design fabrials are known as artifabrians.
```

```
Modern Fabrials
Modern fabrials are created by capturing spren in
gemstones, then constructing a metal framework around
the gems. As spren react to various metals differently,
metals and gemstones can be combined into fabrials
with complex effects.
Most modern fabrials fall into one of three functions:
altering, pairing, or warning. However, a few recently
invented fabrials can’t be classified by any of these
categories.
Altering Fabrials
Altering fabrials are designed to adjust a specific
attribute or property.
Augmenters. Augmenters have pewter frames and
enhance a certain property. A common augmenter is
the heatrial, which increases the heat in a nearby area.
Diminishers. Diminishers have tin frames and reduce a
certain property. A common diminisher is the painrial,
most of which are used to reduce pain—though some
painrials are augmenters instead, heightening the
feeling instead of soothing it.
```

```
Pairing Fabrials
Pairing fabrials are created by splitting the gemstone
containing a spren in half. This results in a pair of
connected gemstones that conserve force, either moving
in parallel or opposite each other.
Conjoiners. Conjoiners are made from a split ruby,
creating a parallel connection over great distances.
Spanreeds, fabrials that connect two pens to facilitate
long-distance communication, are the most widespread
use of conjoiners.
Reversers. Reversers are usually made from a split
amethyst, creating an opposite connection. If one half
of a reverser is raised, the other half lowers. Reversers
were utilized on the Shattered Plains to create
suspended archery towers.
```

```
Nahel Bonds
The Knights Radiant access the surges through Nahel
bonds—one-on-one relationships with Radiant spren.
A human or singer can attract a Radiant spren through
exhibiting personality traits and behaviors desirable to
the spren’s type. This bond empowers both the person
(by granting them access to two surges) and the spren
(by allowing them to maintain their unique identity
and memories in the Physical Realm).
A Nahel bond naturally encourages both parties
to challenge each other and work together to improve
indiv idually and as a pair. As the Radiant swears a series
of Ideals, this bond is further strengthened. A Radiant’s
eligibility to swear these oaths is generally based on
their personal growth and effort to build trust with
their spren. A person can damage or sever their bond
by betraying their Ideals and their spren.
```

```
Shardblades
Shardblades are legendary weapons containing Splinters
of a Shard’s power. They’re around six feet long but very
light, and they can cut through non-living things with
ease and precision. When used against living beings,
Shardblades don’t cut through them, but they can sever
the Spiritual Connection to a body part.
A Shardblade’s origin and abilities depend on its
type. These classifications include Honorblades, Radiant
Shardblades, and dead Shardblades:
Honorblades. Originally belonging to one of the
ten Heralds, each Honorblade can be used as a
Shardblade. It grants its wielder access to two surges
they can use to Surgebind, unbound by Radiant oaths.
Radiant Shardblades. Once a Radiant has attained
the Third Ideal, they can summon their spren as a
Shardblade in the Physical Realm. Sometimes called
living Shardblades, these weapons can adapt their
shape and size to form various melee weapons desired
by their wielder.
Dead Shardblades. Dead Shardblades are the bodies of
deadeye spren who perished due to a Radiant breaking
their oaths. These weapons can’t change shape or size,
but they can still form a rudimentary bond with a
current wielder who can summon and dismiss them.
For more information on Shardblades, see “Shard-
bearer” in chapter 8.
Shardplate
The impervious armor called Shardplate is formed by
lesser spren drawn to a Radiant of the Fourth Ideal. Like
Shardblades, Shardplate can be living or dead; infused
gemstones are required to power dead Plate. For more
information, see “Shardbearer” in chapter 8.

Warning Fabrials
A warning fabrial, made from a heliodor and a bronze
structure, can detect the presence of objects, people, or
other phenomena. The only known warning fabrial is
commonly called the Alerter. The amount of Stormlight
infused into the gemstone determines the range of
the Alerter.

Other Fabrials
Several recently invented fabrials, including the
following, fall outside the standard categories:

**Clocks.** Timepiece fabrials are powered by a logicspren
captured in a smokestone.
**Attractors.** Attractor fabrials can use iron frameworks to
draw in specific substances such as moisture or smoke.
**Repellers.** Repelling fabrials can use steel frameworks to
push away specific materials such as wood or stone.

Ancient Fabrials

Fabrials existed as far back as the Heraldic Epochs,
during the height of the old Knights Radiant. Instead
of entrapping spren in gemstones, the Radiants of this
era knew how to persuade spren to manifest as metal
devices in the Physical Realm, forming marvelous
ancient fabrials.

Surge Fabrials
Ancient fabrials can manipulate surges and replicate
the effects of Surgebinding.

**Soulcasters.** Soulcasters manipulate the surge of
Transformation. Worn on the hand, a Soulcaster
contains a trio of gemstones that can transform
specific materials into others, as determined by the
gems’ colors. Some Soulcasters have gems of different
colors, greatly increasing their utility, while others are
limited by gems of a single color. For more information
on Soulcasting, see “Soulcaster Savant” in chapter 8.
**Oathgates.** Oathgates are enormous fabrials that
manipulate the surge of Transportation. When
activated by an Honorblade or living Shardblade, an
Oathgate can instantaneously transport anything on
its platform or within its control room to either its
paired Oathgate or into Shadesmar (see “Traveling
to Shadesmar” in chapter 7).
**Regrowth Fabrials.** Regrowth fabrials, constructed
from a topaz and a heliodor, manipulate the surge of
Progression to heal severe injuries.
**Suppressors.** Suppressor fabrials use garnets to suppress
usage of Investiture. As a result, they temporarily strip
the powers of Invested entities such as Surgebinders,
Fused, and Radiant spren.

Light Studies
Stormlight has been the subject of much research.
Most of these studies focus on how to transfer it
between gemstones, as creating a fabrial requires
trapping a spren through the rapid transfer of Light.
```

```
Hybrid Light
Light is the manifestation of Investiture on Roshar.
There are three primary Lights: Stormlight (which
is of Honor), Lifelight (of Cultivation), and Voidlight
(of Odium). In addition to these pure Lights, hybrid
Lights can theoretically be created by unifying two of
those Lights. Two of those three hybrids are known to
have been created:
Towerlight. Towerlight is the essence of the Sibling, the
spren who comprises the fabrials of Urithiru. This
hybrid Light of Stormlight and Lifelight can only be
created by the Sibling and their Bondsmith.
Warlight. Warlight is a recent discovery made by
collaboration between the Fused scholar Raboniel and
Queen Navani Kholin. This hybrid Light of Stormlight
and Voidlight can be created by a singer and human
singing the rhythms of Odium and Honor in harmony.
```

```
Indeed, the more she studied
Urithiru, the more she saw the
ancients using simple fabrial
technology to create their marvels.
Modern artifabrians had exceeded
such constructs; her engineers had
repaired, refitted, and streamlined
the lifts, making them function at
several times their original speed.
```

```
Anti-Light
The discovery of anti-Light was another product of
Navani and Raboniel’s research. Anti-Light is a form of
anti-Investiture, and when it comes into contact with
the Light it opposes, it results in mutual annihilation.
Because of this, anti-Light can permanently kill an
Invested entity.
Anti-Voidlight. Anti-Voidlight was rediscovered by
Navani, who figured out a method of creating it.
It can permanently kill beings Invested by Odium,
such as Voidspren or the Fused (see “Odium’s Forces”
in chapter 5).
Anti-Stormlight. Anti-Stormlight was rediscovered
by Raboniel, who figured out a method of creating
it. It can permanently kill beings Invested by Honor,
such as Radiant spren.
```

```
Raysium
Raysium is a God Metal—a metal formed directly
from a Shard (in this case, from the Shard of Odium).
The Fused use it to create weapons that can siphon
Stormlight from a Knight Radiant.
Because raysium naturally conducts Investiture,
a raysium weapon set with a gemstone can kill an
Invested entity. This is done simply by infusing the
gem with the proper anti-Light.

## Nations and Cultures

```
Vorin Kingdoms
The people of the Vorin kingdoms in eastern Roshar
originate from a handful of Silver Kingdoms whose
descendants eventually unified under a single religion,
Vorinism. While these kingdoms have ethnic and
cultural differences, they generally follow the social
customs and rules of Vorinism, including strict gender
roles and an enforced class division between people
with dark eyes and people with light eyes.
Vorin Languages
Most Vorin kingdoms feature a national language
within the broad Vorin language family, or one
influenced by it. Alethi and Veden are dialects of the
same language. Kharbranthian is a linguistic blend
of Vorin and Thaylen.
```

```
The Herdazians and the Unkalaki
Both the Herdazian and Unkalaki people are descended
in part from the singers. Herdazians, whose singer
heritage is seen in their crystalline nails, aren’t
part of the Vorin kingdoms but practice their own
interpretation of Vorinism. They’re known for their
large families and welcoming culture.
The sovereign homeland of the Unkalaki (or
Horneaters) is within the borders of the Vorin kingdom
of Jah Keved, but they don’t practice Vorinism like their
neighbors. Compared to other ethnic groups within Jah
Keved, the Unkalaki are physically unique due to their
distant singer heritage, which granted them stone-like
molars that help them eat shells. The Unkalaki put
a great amount of importance on birth order, which
influences their profession and social role.
```

```
The Makabaki
In western Roshar, the Silver Kingdom of Makabakam
split long ago into a number of nations, some of which
formed the alliance known as the Azish Empire. The
Makabaki people descend from the inhabitants of
this former kingdom. While the cultures of Makabaki
nations vary, they generally don’t use the Vorin methods
of division based on gender and eye color, instead using
title and position to determine class.
Azir, as the center of the Azish Empire, is the most
broadly known of the Makabaki nations. The people

he people of Roshar are determined and
resourceful, thriving despite the world’s ever-
growing threats. This chapter details many
of Roshar’s vibrant peoples and nations as they were
during the Era of Solitude, followed by details on how
they’ve changed since the Everstorm ushered forth the
True Desolation. Chapter 4 provides more information
about other eras in Roshar’s history.
```

## People of Roshar

```
The people of Roshar are an ethnically and culturally
diverse population with two primary origins: the singers,
who are Roshar’s original inhabitants, and the humans,
who fled to Roshar after destroying their own planet.
While the singers granted the humans a safe place to
settle on Roshar, the humans eventually invaded the
rest of the planet.
During the wars known as the Desolations, humans
spread across the continent and divided it into ten
kingdoms known as the Silver Kingdoms. Most of these
kingdoms have since fractured, evolved, or become
defunct, but this era shaped the modern-day people of
Roshar, creating the distinctions in ethnicity, culture,
and language among humans that persist to this day.
For the singers, the end of the Desolations was a
time of catastrophic loss. After their final conflict with
the humans, the vast majority of singers had pieces of
their souls ripped away in a single cataclysmic event
that severed them from their Identity and Connection,
leaving them physically intact but a shadow of their
former selves. A small group known as the listeners
retained some of their identity and culture, but most
singers outside this community were enslaved and
exploited by humans for millennia after. Only the
advent of the Everstorm, brought about by the listeners,
has given the singers back these parts of themselves
and allowed them to fully assert their own culture
and identity.

of Azir prize bureaucracy, organization, respectful
debate, and politeness. While each nation within the
empire has their own cultures and traditions—such as
the distinctive full-body wraps of the Tashikki people—
most cultures within Makabaki nations share a love
for hospitality. Most Makabaki religions center around
one of the Heralds as a singular god, and the others
as demigods under their guidance; the specific Herald
worshipped varies by region.
```

```
Peoples of the Far West
The Shin come from Shinovar, an isolated nation
protected by mountains. They speak Shin and, with
their shorter stature and eyes without epicanthic folds,
they stand out from most other humans on Roshar.
Known both for their humility and xenophobia, the Shin
have strict social structures based on occupation, which
privilege farmers and merchants over warriors. The
Shin practice Stone Shamanism and teach their citizens
not to walk on stone.
The Silver Kingdom of Aimia was destroyed
centuries ago. While some Aimian humans can be
found in the far West, the most remarkable Aimians are
neither human nor singer. Each Dysian Aimian—or
Sleepless—distributes their collective mind across
many smaller insectoid beings (see chapter 8 for more
information on the Sleepless). Meanwhile, the even
more mysterious Siah Aimians sometimes appear as
humanoids with blue-white skin, but they can shift
their forms. Both species are adept at hiding their true
nature, and they’re rarely identified by other peoples,
but both have played important roles in Roshar’s history.
```

```
Other Peoples
The lands around the Purelake—a large inland body of
water in the heart of the continent—are inhabited by the
Selay people, descendants of the Silver Kingdom of Sela
Tales. Purelakers generally live in small villages focused
on the fishing trade.
The Reshi were once a small part of the Silver King-
dom of Rishir, but they’ve lost much of their territory to
the Vorin kingdoms and now live predominantly in the
Reshi Isles. They speak Reshi and are known for their
relaxed, come-what-may culture, which often attracts
outsiders.
The Iriali settled in the Silver Kingdom of Iri. They
believe their people came from another world. Until
their eventual departure from Roshar, as promised
by their religion, the Iriali remain in Iri alongside
Rira—a nation once closely allied with Iri that has
separated from its sister nation.
```

## Alethkar

```
A cavalcade of troops march behind a man in a crisp
embroidered uniform. A noblewoman in a bright silk
dress, her left hand hidden, writes a message for another
scholar. In Alethkar, rules and roles are as regimented
as the renowned Alethi military.
Few nations show Honor and Odium’s influence more
profoundly than the militaristic kingdom of Alethkar.
Bound by rigid societal roles, the Alethi people take
competition and conflict to violent extremes. Alethkar’s
monarch keeps an uneasy peace among ten highprinces,
each with their own territory and military force.
During the Era of Solitude, Alethkar united to
become the largest nation on Roshar, spanning over
four million square miles across the eastern continent.
Its eastern and southern borders rest against largely
empty lands, with the Unclaimed Hills to its east
and the Shattered Plains and Frostlands to its south.
However, Alethkar’s western borders are more disputed,
and it has fought many times with Jah Keved and Herdaz
over the kingdoms’ boundaries. Alethkar also maintains
a few territories off its coasts that help to control its
waters. Within these borders, Alethkar is a rich land,
with lush vegetation and flowing rivers in many areas.
Alethkar has several large cities, and its capital
Kholinar dates back to the Silver Kingdoms era. This
symmetrical city was built around large rock formations
called windblades, which protect it from highstorms.
```

```
Government
Though Alethkar is ruled by a single monarch, the
nation is also divided into ten princedoms, each ruled
by a highprince. The princedoms are named after
the families that control them by inheritance. Each
princedom operates with some independence and fully
controls their part of the Alethi military.
While all ten princedoms are theoretically equal in
power, several titles date back to historical Alethkar
and can be revived in times of need, giving a particular
highprince control of a particular area of the kingdom.
These titles include the following:
Highprince of Commerce , who has authority over
merchants and the safety of the roads they use.
Highprince of Information , who has authority over
criminal investigations, policing, and the appointments
of judges and magistrates.
Highprince of War , who has authority over all war-
related activity.
Highprince of Works, who manages Alethkar’s
infrastructure, ranging from mundane tasks like
sewage disposal to the management of Stormlight.
```

**28** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
Military
Alethkar has the largest military on Roshar, with
around two hundred thousand troops and more than
thirty Shardbearers. The kingdom has spent centuries
in a constant state of war, either internally in conflicts
between highprinces, or externally with other nations.
Military service in Alethkar is believed to be the highest
religious Calling an Alethi can undertake. It’s also one
of the most reliable ways to move up in Alethi society,
though those at the bottom are unlikely to rise higher
than squadleader. Many soldiers go to war in the
mostly futile hope that they might win ownership of a
Shardblade by defeating a Shardbearer—and through
that process, move up in society.
Most rank-and-file soldiers wield spears or bows,
as swords are restricted to lighteyed troops and wielded
only by officers. While horses are uncommon on Roshar,
the Alethi army does have access to them for officers,
scouts, and even cavalry. (For more information on
Alethi officers and soldiers, see “Brightlord” and
“Soldier” in chapter 8.)
The Alethi military may seem a unified force under
the monarch’s power, but the ruler of Alethkar only
```

```
directly commands approximately 250 royal guards.
The remainder of the military is commanded by the
highprinces, with each leading their own forces and
pursuing their own goals. The monarch maintains
control over the princedoms in part by controlling
most of Alethkar’s ardent Soulcasters, who are needed
to help the military move from place to place and feed
its soldiers.
The Alethi military is well-armed and battle-
tested, but it also owes much of its success to Odium’s
influence. The Thrill, a supernatural battle rage caused
by the Unmade Nergaoul, was concentrated in Alethkar
during the Era of Solitude. The Thrill’s sinister
influence was defeated during the True Desolation,
but its bloodstained legacy taints Alethi history.
```

```
Alethi Culture
While 90 percent of Alethkar’s population is human,
the nation has historically exploited a significant
population of enslaved “parshmen”—the descendants
of singers whose minds and souls were devastated by the
imprisonment of Ba-Ado-Mishram (see “Singers and
Listeners” at the end of this chapter).
```

```
Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures 29
```

ROMAIN KURDI

```
Alethi humans are generally considered warlike and
culturally rigid. In addition to their caste system based
on eye color, they have a prescribed division of genders,
a culture that glorifies war, and a callous attitude
toward slavery.
Those of Alethi ethnicity are usually tan in
complexion with dark hair, though those with mixed
heritage can have multicolored hair. Alethi also tend
to be tall, averaging nearly a foot taller than Rosharans
from westerly lands. Like most people on Roshar, they
have eyes with epicanthal folds.
The majority of citizens belong to the Alethi
ethnicity, but Alethkar is also home to significant
populations of Herdazians and Vedens, creating a
melting pot of language and culture.
Social Order
Culturally, Alethi favor restraint over outward displays
of emotion. Couples are expected to avoid showing
public affection toward each other, and physical
closeness between parent and child is generally reserved
for younger children.
Due to their interpretation of the Vorin religion,
Alethi avoid guessing what the future may bring. This
extends even into social practices, and they disdain any
form of gambling that relies on speculation.
Alethi are generally very rule-bound, believing in
and obeying behavior norms that are determined by
```

```
each individual Alethi’s status and role. The Alethi not
only embrace Vorinism (see “Vorinism” in chapter 3),
which divides humans by gender and eye color, but
they further codify it, creating hierarchies that echo
those found within their military. It should come as
no surprise that the common people hold widespread
resentment toward those of high status. Even within the
nobility, individuals who reject tradition and explore
new ideas are often subject to mockery and contempt.
Caste System
Like most nations that practice the Vorin religion,
human society in Alethkar is divided into two castes
determined by the lightness of a person’s eyes. Most
Alethi people have eyes of darker colors like brown,
black, or deep violet; these people, called darkeyes, are
members of the lower caste (which ranks people into
ten nahns). Meanwhile, people with lighter shades like
blue, tan, and lavender are called lighteyes; believing
themselves superior, they form the upper caste (which
ranks people into ten dahns). For more information
on Vorinism’s view on lighteyes and darkeyes, see
“Vorinism” in chapter 3.
```

```
“Keep forgetting I’m here,
do you? You prefer to
ignore darkeyes.”
```

```
aleThi
darkeyes
```

**30** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
Dahns
The highest rank for a lighteyes is first dahn, ranging
down to tenth dahn at the lowest. It’s very difficult to
raise one’s dahn, which requires gaining an important
position, becoming a Shardbearer (see “Shardbearer”
in chapter 8), or at lower dahns, buying a higher rank.
Many ranks also tie directly to either governance or
inheritance, making them difficult to come by.
```

```
The first dahn is held solely by a nation’s monarch,
and the second dahn by the highprinces. The third
dahn is held by those related to members of the first two,
as well as highlords and high-ranking members of the
military. By contrast, the tenth dahn is generally held
by those who must earn their living; these people are
called tenners.
Nahns
The ranks for darkeyes similarly range from one to
ten. Those within the highest ranks of first and second
nahn are considered full citizens of Alethkar with the
right of free travel, and they can even marry into a
lighteyed family. Meanwhile, Alethi within the tenth
nahn can be sold into slavery. The right to avoid military
conscription varies from one individual to another;
someone of a higher nahn might avoid being forced to
join the Alethi military, but only if they also show they
provide an irreplaceable service. Members of lower
nahns are often eager to join the military—one of the
few paths to higher rank in Alethi society.

```
Eye Color and Castes in Roshar
Across the Vorin nations of Roshar, discrimination based
on eye lightness and classism are so thoroughly embedded
in society that the terms “darkeyes” and “lighteyes”
are routinely used to refer to people of the two castes.
However, groups playing the Cosmere RPG may wish to
approach these terms with care, given their intersection
with real-world racism. For suggestions on how to
approach sensitive topics at the table, review the Safety
Guide in chapter 13 of the Stormlight Handbook.

men are forbidden to read, and their writing is limited
to a few simple glyphs. Men are expected to instead
engage in physical labor, military service, and similarly
physical pursuits. (For more information on Vorin
gender restrictions, see “Vorinism” in chapter 3.)
Alethi fashion is shaped both by gender roles
and the caste system. Lighteyed men generally wear
embroidered suits in darker colors that are considered
more masculine, such as maroon, navy, forest green,
and deep burnt orange. Women often wear a brightly
colored one-piece silk dress known as the Vorin havah.
Despite these gender roles, religious ardents enjoy
relative freedom from such expectations. Ardents of all
genders wear robes and shave their heads, and they can
serve equally without restrictions on writing or studying
combat. Some ardents choose to cover their safehands
with gloves for a more feminine style, though this
isn’t required.
```

```
Slavery
Slavery is more prevalent in Alethkar than in many
other parts of Roshar. Besides singers, Alethi law also
allows the enslavement of humans who are prisoners
of war, debtors, or accused criminals. While human
slavery isn’t hereditary, it’s a constant threat for anyone
in the tenth nahn. Those who manage to buy their
freedom must spend the rest of their lives marked
with the slave brands they acquired during their
enslavement.
```

```
Gender Restrictions
As is customary for nations that practice Vorinism,
Alethkar has strict and narrow gender roles that apply
to all citizens—except ardents. These roles include a
strict gender binary. Women are generally expected
to be scholars, businesswomen, and scribes. From
adolescence onward, women are also expected to cover
their left hands, known as their safehands. Meanwhile,
```

**32** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
Religion
Most Alethi believe in the Almighty and practice Vorin-
ism on some level, choosing a Calling (as their goal in
life) and a Glory (as an aspect of the Almighty they wish
to make present in their life). Despite this set of beliefs,
most Alethi aren’t particularly devout, embracing more
cultural aspects of Vorinism than religious ones. They
leave the rituals, prayers, and other regular practices
of Vorinism to the ardents, rarely interacting with the
Almighty outside of the occasional prayer. (See “Vorin-
ism” in chapter 3 for more details on this religion.)
Ardents, the priests of Vorinism, enter into
servitude to nobles or the monarch, and they face some
restrictions—they can’t own property or hold political
or social offices. However, ardents are highly respected
and, as the only people permitted to use Soulcasters,
they wield great influence. Ardents can choose to leave
the ardentia at any time without penalty.
```

```
Resources
Alethkar’s most notable resource is arguably its military
force, including ten highprince armies comprised of
thousands of fierce warriors, plus an impressive collec-
tion of around twenty known Shardblades. The nation’s
foothold on the Shattered Plains secures massive
emerald gemhearts from chasmfiend hunts. In terms of
agriculture, the farms of Alethkar grow tallew and lavis
grains, stagm tubers, and a vast array of spices, and
they raise hogs, crabs, and chulls as livestock. Alethkar
also produces exquisite wines of varying colors, alcohol
concentrations, and flavor profiles.

History
Following the end of the Silver Kingdoms era,
Alethkar fell under the power of the Hierocracy of
the Vorin faith, which sought to conquer all Roshar
and unite it under Vorinism. Alethkar became the
Hierocracy’s physical center of power as it attempted
to extend its control to the west. The Hierocracy was
overthrown by the Sunmaker, who united the kingdom
before he turned to conquest and genocide—notably
killing one in ten people of the Azish Empire during
various capricious acts of violence. When he died
suddenly of an illness, his ten children squabbled over
the kingdom, eventually creating the princedoms that
remained the center of Alethi governance until King
Gavilar’s reign.
Before Gavilar Kholin became king, he began
working with his brother Dalinar to follow in the
Sunmaker’s footsteps and unite Alethkar. Over a
decade of brutal military campaigning, the brothers
crushed any resistance to a united Alethkar. The
experience left Dalinar haunted by those he massacred,
but Alethi nobles lauded the Kholin brothers for their
glorious victory.
```

```
After the Everstorm
With the arrival of the True Desolation, perhaps
no other nation has experienced as much change as
Alethkar. Through the Everstorm, enslaved singers
were liberated from slaveform and regained their
individuality and Connection. They can now think and
act freely for themselves. Processing their enslavement
by the humans has led most of these singers to feelings
of sorrow and deep anger. In Alethkar, more so than in
any other nation, the awakened singers sought violent
retribution.
Recognizing this upheaval as an opportunity to
eliminate Alethkar as a threat, Odium’s forces struck the
nation before they could mount a defense. King Elhokar
Kholin, Gavilar’s son and heir, was slain in a failed
attempt to defend the capital city of Kholinar. Now
that the capital has fallen, the nation’s new monarch,
Queen Jasnah Kholin, rules in exile from Urithiru.

another. While Alethi law doesn’t forbid a woman from
ruling as monarch, Jasnah’s rise to the throne is one of
many dramatic cultural changes wrought by the return
of the Knights Radiant.
The return of the Knights Radiant has challenged
the oppressive laws of Alethi society. Women now wield
Shardblades as Knights Radiant, fighting alongside
men. Dalinar, once seen as a paragon of Alethi
masculinity, has written a book expressing shame for
those he killed in acts of wrath. Queen Jasnah has
moved to abolish singer and human slavery, and caste
distinctions based on eye color now seem increasingly
arbitrary. It’s a precarious time for the Alethi people,
but one in which individuals have unprecedented
opportunities to shape the future.
Alethi Singers
For millennia, the singers of Alethkar were treated as
property and ordered to work tirelessly for the humans
who enslaved them. Due to the loss of their identities
and agency at the end of the False Desolation, these
singers couldn’t object or fight back against oppression.
They existed in what the listeners call slaveform,
which holds the mind captive and allows only
minimal speech.
Life as a “parshman” was exhausting, thankless,
and shrouded in a thick mental haze. As enslaved singers
performed the work demanded of them—ranging from
farming and construction to cooking and childcare—
they could observe and understand most of what was
happening around them. However, they couldn’t act of
their own accord, proactively choose tasks their masters
hadn’t established for them, or outwardly express the
emotional anguish they felt. Singer families were often
cruelly ripped apart by slavers selling parents, children,
partners, and friends to other slave masters.
When the Everstorm arrived and healed the souls of
singers across Roshar, many of them unsurprisingly felt
deep anger toward humankind. In Alethkar, the singers
fought back. Many chose violence, some even going so
far as to enslave their former masters. Others focused
on escape, then encountered Voidspren sentries and
Fused overseers who guided them toward vengeance.
Shaped by the culture that had abused them for
generations, the singers of Alethkar became the
vanguard of Odium’s army.

## Azish Empire

```
Scholars climb out of a chull rickshaw, challenging each
other’s perspectives with decorum and gusto. The dry breeze
carries the faint scent of burning truthberry leaves, hinting
at a nearby celebration. A large group of soldiers wearing
clinking bronze armor and bright patterned caps march in
perfect unison as they exchange polite jokes on their way to
report for duty. In Azir, bureaucracy is a way of life, and
everyone has a designated role to bolster the empire.
The Azish Empire is composed of nine member states
within the Makabaki region of southwestern Roshar.
Its people belong to the Makabaki ethnic group, and they
generally have very dark brown skin tones and dark hair.
While there are a couple dozen different spoken
and written Makabaki languages, Azish is the most
common and is widely understood within the region.
Deaf citizens of the empire favor Azish Sign Language,
which is also practiced by ambassadors and translators.
Due to the language’s robust vocabulary and contextual
precision, its use has spread to other nations of Roshar.
Azir is the largest and most powerful nation in the
empire, maintaining its leadership through shared
resources and military strength.
```

```
Azir
In the nation of Azir, bureaucracy reigns supreme
and centuries-old laws anchor the ever-expanding
legislation. Scribes keep the population informed of
recent changes in official policy by periodically releasing
publications on the topic. The people of Azir are
generally well-versed in the law, and they’re expected
to comply with new laws within one month of them
being passed.
```

```
Government
The ruler of the Azish Empire, the Prime Aqasix, is
elected by esteemed political advisors called viziers,
but the Prime is a revered figurehead with limited
power. During the Prime’s reign, they’re stationed at
the Bronze Palace and accompanied by viziers, scribes,
and religious leaders called scions. Viziers persuade and
guide the Prime, and they can even overrule the Prime
when they see fit. Citizens can also challenge a mandate
made by the Prime, though they’re less likely to succeed.
When a Prime Aqasix dies, the viziers begin their search
for the next.

are no formal punishments associated with their
refusal, but the stigma of going against the perceived
order of society can be an uncomfortable cost. On a
legal level, couples who aren’t heterosexual must fill
out different paperwork to be legally married, but
they’re otherwise validated.
Religion
The national religion of Azir worships the Kadasixes,
the Azish interpretation of the Heralds. Yaezir—
otherwise known as Jezrien—is especially revered as
the Kadasix of Kings, and the Prime Aqasix’s calling
is to uphold his interests.
Priests of the Azish religion, called scions, serve
as government officials in all ranks of the bureaucracy.
Every member state of the Azish Empire has their own
religion, each worshipping its chosen Herald as the
central divine being of their theology.
```

```
Resources
Azir is a large country with many industries. Major
exports include grains such as clema and tallew, textile
products, books, and sapphire gemstones (which are
the gemhearts of mawli, a mid-sized greatshell species).
Invested tools such as Soulcasters and Shardblades
are used to benefit society, not just the individuals
who wield them. While Soulcasters are exceedingly
rare in Azir, a collection of Shardblades known
as Imperial Shardblades are lent to select people.
These Shardbearers take on various jobs as warriors
and workers within Azir and the empire’s member
countries.
Oathgate
An Oathgate stands in the Grand Market of Azir’s
capital, Azimir.
```

```
Imperial Shardblades
While the Shardbearers of other nations might scoff
at the idea of using their Shardblades for non-combat
occupational purposes, the Azish Empire has used this
tradition to carve entire cities into existence. Since most
member countries don’t have Shardblades, this method
of sharing access for specialized work and mercenary jobs
incentivizes the nine nations to remain unified.
People who wield Imperial Shardblades are highly
esteemed throughout the empire, and they take pride in
what they do. In exchange for using these Blades, their
wielders send part of their earnings back to the Bronze
Palace. Regulations ensure Imperial Shardblades are
utilized responsibly.
```

Azir’s governing body has many levels, all of which
are considered prestigious. Any citizen can become a
public servant by passing a rigorous exam. The wealthy
fill most of these roles due to their access to expensive
higher education; after all, the presentation of an
argument is often more convincing to the Azish than
the argument itself. However, many common applicants
also qualify and become public servants too.
Laws are enforced by constables. Instead of holding
regional assignments, constables are dispatched from
one area to the next on a regular basis. This is designed
to encourage impartiality, better allocate personnel,
and allow for extensive continuing-education seminars
between transfers.

Military
Discipline, coordination, and a clear chain of command
are basic principles of the Azish military. Alethi and
Veden troops have a reputation for being mightier than
Azish troops, but the obedience and synchronization
of the Azish military is second to none.
Soldiers wear plated mail and carry bows, polearms,
and greatshields. The troops are divided into battalions
of a thousand soldiers each. Uniform colors play a vital
role in identifying a soldier’s position and the battalion
they belong to. Most Azish soldiers are either men or
masculine-presenting.

Azish Culture
The people of Azir generally strive for order, compliance,
and courtesy. Disagreements are encouraged in their
culture, so long as the argument is presented with an
agreeable attitude (on the surface) and are conducted
through prescribed channels.
Government officials are considered the top tier of
human society in Azir. The complex patterns woven
into their clothing reflect both their specific rank within
the government structure and their family heritage.
In theory, the circumstances of a person’s birth don’t
define their merit and opportunities, and the Azish
celebrate the concept of social advancement. Lighteyed
Azish are a very small minority, and they aren’t seen as
superior to their peers. Most occupations aren’t gender-
specific, and the Azish don’t practice Vorin traditions
such as the concealment of safehands.
In addition to official laws, the Azish are expected
to follow their nation’s social customs. This can
be harmful when certain social customs are poorly
informed or flawed. For example, couples of all genders
court openly and can marry, but some Azish people
expect married couples to model the roles of one man
and one woman, regardless of their gender identities.
Not everyone chooses to follow social customs, as there

Azimir
Azimir, the capital of Azir, is the grandest city in the
Azish Empire, and its people believe their capital’s
layout is divinely inspired. The city’s boulevards form
an intricate urban grid, with orderly lines and rigid
symmetry that exemplify the ideals of Azish culture.
Public buildings and private residences alike stand
on foundations that date back to the time of the
Dawnsingers.
The cosmopolitan streets of Azimir bustle with
people from across the empire and beyond. On any
given day, one might see Thaylen merchants, Alethi
diplomats, and Iriali tourists among citizens from every
corner of the Azish Empire. Visitors regard Azimir as
one of the safest metropolises in the world—perhaps
because its black-uniformed constables are notorious for
burying perpetrators in mountains of legal paperwork.
```

```
Azimir’s resident population includes Roshar’s
largest concentration of civil servants, barristers, and
bureaucrats. Even people who don’t work directly for
the government usually work to feed, clothe, house, and
entertain the city’s army of administrators.
The empire commands a handful of Soulcasters,
including one housed in Azimir that produces bronze.
This artifact’s legacy can be seen throughout the city:
many rooftops are bronze, and the emperor’s Bronze
Palace features columns, domes, and even gardens
Soulcast in lustrous bronze.
The city’s largest bronze dome covers Azimir’s
Oathgate. This building once housed the city’s Grand
Market, but news of the Oathgate’s strategic importance
led city officials to fortify the structure and evacuate all
merchants. Phalanxes of Azish heavy infantry surround
the Oathgate, while others stand ready to defend the
city itself, all under the oversight of the Commandant
Supreme of the Imperial Guard.

Other Member Countries
Azir leads the Azish Empire and is charged with
considering the needs of its members. Each member
country is valued for its unique contributions, though
their favor with Azir fluctuates with time.
```

```
Tashikk
In Tashikk, information is as good as spheres.
A sophisticated network of relay stations has made
Tashikk the greatest spanreed hub on Roshar. Although
a prince sits on the throne, Azish-style bureaucracy
thrives there. Green fields stretch on as far as the eye
can see, flat and unimposing. In terms of its military
force, Tashikk is most known for its formidable navy,
which it partners with Azir to maintain.
Most Tashikki people worship Tashi (their name
for the Herald Ishar) along with an evil god called
Nun Raylisi, who is based on Odium. The humans of
Tashikk are expected to wear shiquas unless they have
occupational exemptions. These body wraps are made
from a continuous strip of fabric that covers the wearer
from head to toe, shielding them from the hateful gaze
of Nun Raylisi.
```

```
The subterranean city of Yeddaw is the jewel of the
Tashikki people. Its trenches were masterfully hewn by
Azir’s Imperial Shardblades. The center of the city is its
tallest point, forming an almost imperceptible cone that
guides water from highstorms down the streets toward
drain chutes on the outskirts.
Yezier
The princess of Yezier spends half her time in Azir.
Many people speculate that she does so to foster a
close relationship with the Azish Empire’s seat of
power, despite not always choosing to follow its lead
as closely as nations such as Tashikk.
World-class highstorm scholars in Yezier use
advanced mathematical theorems to track and predict
the arrival of highstorms across Roshar. They deliver
their calculated forecasts to agents in Tashikk via
spanreed, where the forecasts are sold and widely
distributed.
Yezier produces some of Roshar’s most exciting
and innovative fashions. Bulk designs are made near
the Yezier and Liafor border for export. Top fashion
designers from the two nations travel the world with
their tailors to make and sell bespoke pieces to foreign
nobility. They incorporate fine Makabaki fabrics with
stylistic modifications to suit the customs and religious
requirements of their host countries.
```

```
Emul
Emul is a struggling nation on the brink of collapse.
Led by a Prime but heavily fractured by its ongoing
war with Tukar, Emul is short on resources and allies.
Tukar continues to hunger after the prized port city
of Sesemalex Dar, which is within reach of the border
between the two nations. The city is a significant
symbol of Emuli religious identity and an economic
powerhouse.
The Emuli military has a high percentage of drafted
soldiers. Bows are the Emuli’s weapon of choice, but the
Tukari know this and have adjusted their assault strategy
to force the Emuli into close combat. Emuli cavalry
were once renowned, wielding curved kusu blades
from horseback, but most of their steeds have been lost
in the war.
On Emul’s eastern border, a vast mountain range
hides the city of Urithiru and the Valley, home of
the Nightwatcher (see “Unique Spren” in chapter 1).
Foreigners prefer to travel there through Emul when
possible, given the nation’s long-standing tradition of
hospitality. Gifts and greetings are especially important
in Emuli culture; a traveler is expected to bring a
symbolic gift of fruit for their host family, and even
strangers greet one another with warm salutations.

While most Emuli people don’t wear the shiquas
of their Tashikki neighbors, head-wraps are common
among Emuli humans of all genders. These range
from practical headbands worn by soldiers to elaborate
headdresses worn at weddings.
Steen
In Steen, the wind carries the scent of the Southern
Depths’ brine mingled with astringent textile treatments.
Most people born there never leave, and those who do
typically become migrating laborers for hire, such as
sailors or mercenaries. The people of Steen follow unique
grooming customs, such as men wrapping their beards in
cords as if bundling raw seasilk after harvest.
Steen is ruled by a prince and merchant lords.
In place of a military, the government hires returned
mercenaries who have proven themselves abroad. The
general attitude of the merchant lords is exemplified
by the Steen saying, “If there are two mercenaries at a
party, pay both twice.” They believe that if their enemy
is equally matched, a battle is better fought with spheres
than blades. As a result, quarrels with other Azish
Empire states can typically be resolved by adjusting
export prices of seasilk to coax them into cooperation.
Seasilk farming, textile treatment, and dye production
are Steen’s primary industries. The lucrative seasilk trade
begins by harvesting that white plant fiber, which grows
atop the ocean and resembles moss. Seasilk harvesters
travel on wide, shallow boats; their oars serve as a
paddle on one side, while the other contains a blade to
cut through seasilk tangles. The finest strands of seasilk
are woven into smooth, lustrous fabric for nobility, while
the coarser strands are made into a nubby canvas-like
material better suited for soldiers and artisans.
```

```
Alm
Cozied up to the mountains dividing it from Shinovar,
Alm remains an enigma to most of Roshar. Its popu-
lation is incredibly small, and it doesn’t produce any
noteworthy exports. The people of Alm pride themselves
on being self-sustained, though they accept Azir’s
emperor as their own.
Alm has no major cities, and its designated diplomat
family lives in a quaint palace near the shared border
with Yezier. Citizens live in small villages or on remote
homesteads. The land is fertile enough for crops, and
a large river in southeastern Alm provides additional
sustenance. To maintain good relations with the Bronze
```

Sesemalex Dar,

LOGAN FELICIANO capital of Emul.

```
Palace, Alm’s diplomat family sends ambassadors and
bundles of dried fruits that only grow in Alm. In the
past, the Bronze Palace sent them enslaved singers to
use as palace servants—but unbeknownst to Azir, these
singers were liberated on their arrival in Alm, then given
cottages to live in or roam as they please.
In contrast with Yezier’s fixation with fashion and
social validation, the people of Alm wear muted light
colors, signifying their disinterest in competition and
vanity. When someone experiences a major life event
such as coming of age, marriage, or the death of a loved
one, it’s customary to travel to the river in the southeast
to feel the transitory nature of life, then travel to the
mountains in the west to feel a sense of permanence.
Desh
Long loyal to Azir, Desh is a quiet sentinel of military
power and emergency provisions. Its strategic position
against Roshar’s western mountains provides a natural
defensive border and a series of labyrinthine caves for
storing grain and war fabrials. The kingdom is ruled by
a council of Deshi royalty and retired Azish generals.
Although Desh sends ambassadors to nations near and
far, they typically serve more as spies than diplomats.
Children are treated with the utmost courtesy
in Desh. An honorific—Talga—is given to all who
can’t fight due to youth, old age, illness, or disability.
Although soldiers in Desh are commanded by the royal
council, soldiers consider themselves to be in service of
their goddess Vedahha and all Talga.
Adults with able bodies and the spirits of guardians
are conscripted to military service as active-duty soldiers
or reserves. Those with temperaments too gentle for war
become surgeons, apothecaries, farmers, priests, scribes,
artifabrians, teachers, and merchants. Some become
nomads and keep to the mountains, building obelisks to
designate waystops.
Deshi people typically eat stewed grains, fried vines,
roasted goat meat and various preparations of soft-
shelled cremlings. On holidays, some enjoy a rare treat
of sparkling fruit liquor from Alm.
In the eastern region of Desh, vast steppes contain
unusually pure sandstone that’s ideal for making glass
for spheres. Here, military reserves cart the crushed
sandstone to the Azish border. It’s then sold and
transported to Jah Keved, where it’s heated and mixed
with minerals from the Bavland mines to produce
finished sphere glass. Sand runners are a testament to
Deshi efficiency, as the kingdom’s soldiers help fund its
robust military, along with subsidies from Azir. Decades
have passed since Desh mobilized its impressive armies,
but times of peace haven’t eroded its prowess.
```

```
Marat
The kingdom of Marat is of little note on the global
political stage. Its citizens are divided into tribes, each
ruled by an elder brother. Some customs are tribe-
specific, while others are universal. Marat’s primary
exports include textiles, fine rugs, and furniture.
Families pass down auspicious patterns that become
more intricate with each generation. If a family includes
rugmakers or carpenters, they integrate their ancestral
pattern into each piece they make.
The port city of Rossen Dar is Marat’s center of
commerce. Foreign tradespeople crowd the city’s
bazaar, eager to purchase fine housewares. A cluster of
luxury villas, constructed entirely of crem, stands proud
in Rossen Dar’s northern reaches. For centuries, expert
masons have maintained these villas with unwavering
devotion. After every highstorm, crem sludge on the
roofs and sides of the villas is spread out evenly to
preserve their structural integrity and overall design.
Then begins the tedious work of etching ancestral
patterns back into every brick while the crem is still
wet. Through the ages, these villas have grown nearer
together as sediment from highstorms increases their
bulk. Few people are privy to what the insides of the
villas look like, but rumors suggest the entry halls are
as long as the interior living spaces within.
```

```
Tukar
The god-priest Tezim reigns over Tukar with veiled
agendas and a veiled identity. Tukar is considered
the most contentious of the Azish Empire’s member
countries, and it’s responsible for waging a bloody and
drawn-out war known as the Eighty’s War with its
fellow member state, Emul. Prior to that war, Tukar
was known for exporting perfume, jewelry, and skilled
mercenaries.
Tukari people tend to be emotionally reactive, for
better and worse. Refusing to show one’s emotions
is seen as a sign of disrespect and insincerity. They
fight fiercely and pursue their beliefs with reckless
abandon. For this, outsiders regard the Tukari as
brazen and volatile.
Tukar is the coldest Makabaki nation, and people
living there favor enveloping garments made of thick,
coarse fabric. Tukari humans craft necklaces and
bracelets in ringed, chain-like patterns that represent
bonds, a symbol of their god-priest. Unbeknownst to
the Tukari, Tezim is secretly the Herald Ishar.

After the Everstorm
The True Desolation brought forth a time of profound
inaction and international contention for the Azish
Empire. After Azish singers awakened in the Everstorm,
they organized to sue for compensation for their
lifetimes of labor for the empire. Envoyforms took this
appeal to the Azish legal system, demanding formal
economic redress for the extralegal appropriation of
their labor. However, the Bronze Palace didn’t enter
these negotiations in good faith; they did so merely to
forestall armed conflict. Once the singers concluded
that humans had no intention of treating singers
fairly under the law, they abandoned this pursuit.
Most joined Odium’s forces, seeking justice
through military victory.
```

```
Yanagawn the First, Prime Aqasix of Azir, was an
early participant in negotiations with Dalinar and
Navani’s Coalition of Monarchs. He was cagey at first
and refused to grant access to Azir’s Oathgate. However,
after Odium’s forces quickly overran the small kingdom
of Marat, the Azish government agreed to join the
coalition out of desperation.
Azir has struggled to work with its member states,
some of whom demand greater support or fail to grasp
the gravity of the situation. Despite preparing the
necessary paperwork to take full control of Deshi reserve
armies, the royal family is reluctant to relinquish control
to the Bronze Palace until the situation intensifies. By
appeasing Azir on the surface, Alm strives to maintain
any protection it is entitled to as part of the empire, but
the nation has secretly become a hub for singers who
wish to support neither side of the global conflict.
Azir withdrew its support from the Alethi upon
misinterpreting the Battle of Thaylen Field. However,
Azir later reentered negotiations with Alethkar to
recapture lost territory in Emul after it was invaded by
Odium’s forces. Emperor Yanagawn looks favorably on
Dalinar Kholin and the Knights Radiant. While bound
by laws that make him little more than a figurehead,
he has generally sought ways to support the coalition
as the war continues.
```

```
Azish Singers
During the Era of Solitude, the enslaved singers of
Azir were said to be the most organized and equitably
assigned parshmen on Roshar, though these state ments
offered scant comfort to the singers forced to live and
work as prized livestock instead of as people. Azir’s
farming industry was extremely dependent on singer
labor, allocating nearly all enslaved singers to agri-
culture during planting and harvesting seasons.
When the singers in Azir awakened, they had hope
that the empire’s famously egalitarian laws would apply
to them. Those who sued for citizenship and back pay
were well justified—and they were deeply disappointed
by the humans’ indifference and disdain. Some singers
may hold out hope that the right legal appeal could forge
a path to peace, but most have joined Odium’s forces
with the understanding that the victors will have the
chance to write laws for a new society led by singers.

Scenes from a family

farmstead in Herdaz.

```
Herdazian Culture
Thanks to distant singer ancestry, most Herdazians are
better equipped to withstand the harsh conditions of
Roshar than most other humans. They have an innate
resistance to poisons, including firemoss and other
harmful substances used recreationally, so higher doses
of toxins are needed for them to feel the same effects.
Nearly all Herdazians have brown hair, and their brown
skin is generally lighter than the Makabaki and darker
than the Alethi.
In Herdaz, fingernails are tools. Crystalline and
tinted toward the cuticle, Herdazian fingernails
replicate the properties of flint when struck with
steel. Herdazians take advantage of this property with
sparkflickers, a uniquely Herdazian tool. These are
similar to wide rings, worn over the top of a finger
and fashioned from steel. When struck by a Herdazian
fingernail, a sparkflicker produces sparks that can start
a fire. Receiving a sparkflicker from one’s parents is an
important coming-of-age experience for the children
of ranchers, as the gift signifies they can be trusted
with starting fires.
Herdazians hold fast to the belief that every person
is valuable to society, no matter their role. For example,
asexual Herdazians don’t face social pressure to
procreate and are celebrated for their accomplishments.
A long history of border conflicts with Alethkar,
including Dalinar Kholin’s four-year quest to fortify
the northern Alethi territory, have left bitter feelings.
Herdazians are careful to avoid outright offending the
military power sharing their southern border, yet they
intentionally diverge in culturally significant ways.
These include their atypical practice of the Vorin
religion and their ban on human slavery.
```

```
Diaspora
For generations, Herdazians have emigrated to countries
near and far. The diaspora has grown to include nearly
half of the Herdazians on Roshar. Since Herdazians
consider themselves related to anyone with whom they
share even minor ancestral commonality, family and
a sense of home can be found almost anywhere.
```

## Herdaz

```
A blanket of lukewarm fog hovers over crop fields as the
sun begins its graceful ascent. Villagers embrace and share
laughter as they set off for an honest day’s work. Delicate
wisps of smoke drift from sculptural chimneys painted in
bright colors. In Herdaz, abundance is celebrated modestly,
and everyone is family.
Known for its prosperous agriculture and family-
centered communities, Herdaz is shaped like a crown
atop the eastern flank of Roshar. Peninsulas reach
toward the Reshi Sea above and to the west, and toward
the Steamwater Ocean in the east. Due to its humid and
temperate climate, Herdaz is especially lush and verdant
compared to surrounding nations, though not as green
as Shinovar in the far west of Roshar.
Herdaz is a bountiful nation, and its agricultural
output is higher per capita than larger neighbors like
Alethkar and Jah Keved. Its primary language is
Herdazian, and its primary exports include crops and
pig’s hide.
```

```
Government
Herdaz is ruled by a beloved king. The Herdazian
palace is famous for its glyph chimneys—all 203 of
them—which represent the officially recognized family
ranches of the kingdom. Once per year, the king invites
commoner representatives from each ranch to attend
their designated chimney, releasing synchronized trails
of smoke to represent unity.
```

```
Military
Bordered by much larger nations which it can’t hope to
match in raw military strength, Herdaz has prioritized
a military that relies more on cleverness, comradery,
and hope. Promotions to higher ranks are usually given
with term limits, designed to incentivize hard work and
leadership, as well as to encourage humility and the
ability to step down gracefully once one has passed their
fighting prime. When a soldier exhibits legendary merit,
they are awarded an honorific—enne—after their name
and are no longer beholden to term limits. Dieno enne
Calah, also known as the Mink, is one such legend.
```

```
Each report sounded like the Herdazians
were nearly finished, and so resources
were allocated to more winnable fronts.
But each time, Herdaz stood strong,
relentlessly harrying the enemy.

```
Religion
While most citizens of orthodox Vorin nations (such as
Alethkar and Jah Keved) strive to strictly uphold the
traditions and customs of their religion, Herdazians care
less about the formal establishment of the Vorin church.
Instead, they prioritize their individual connections to
the deity the church venerates. Herdazian women cover
their safehands with gloves or long sleeves, following the
tradition of limiting use of their left hands, but doing so
in a slightly more practical manner.
Most Herdazian homes have a large chimney for a
fireplace, as well as a smaller ornamental one to carry
smoke from burning glyphwards during personal
worship. Some Herdazians carry sparkflickers engraved
with religious symbols, though it’s considered tacky
to flaunt them.
```

```
Resources
Fertile land is the most valuable natural resource in
Herdaz, and crops are grown for food and textiles.
More perishable crops are harvested at peak ripeness
and sold and traded to neighboring villages and cities.
Grains are generally dried for exporting or used to make
fried flatbread for dishes such as chouta—a wrap made
with Soulcast meat and a mild-but-flavorful sauce.
Hog ranching is a common occupation in Herdaz.
Meat is sold freshly butchered or preserved as heavily
salted jerky, then shipped off promptly for sale in
neighboring nations, lest it become spoiled from
humidity. Herdazian hog leather is used for clothing,
armor, saddles, tools, and furniture. It’s famous for
its smooth grain and durability.

Along the northern coast, massive crab-like
greatshells roam the beaches. Though their gemhearts
are valuable, Herdazians seldom hunt them due to the
significant danger the creatures pose. Greatshells prefer
to inhabit the tips of the Herdazian peninsulas, while
the lower regions of the peninsulas can typically be used
for fishing and catching smaller crustaceans. Fishing is
seen as a job for the poor and landless. Even sticking to
well-established fishing spots doesn’t guarantee safety.
Fisherfolk generally take turns keeping watch, ready to
abandon their day’s catch at a moment’s notice in the
event of a greatshell sighting. The greatshells prefer to
keep to themselves, but they become hostile if humans
wander near a fishing encampment while the greatshells
are present.
Land Conflicts
Disputes over land ownership are common in Herdaz.
While most Herdazians who emigrate elsewhere seldom
return, it can be treacherous when they do so to reclaim
their ancestral farms. The king refuses to get involved,
leaving the messy task of determining ownership
to appointed land magistrates. To reclaim land, a
Herdazian must not only prove their bloodline is more
closely tied to the land’s first recorded owners, but also
prove greater fitness to care for the land than its current
owners. These disputes can stretch on for decades
without resolution, and most result in the two families
agreeing to merge or duel each other for the land.
```

```
After the Everstorm
During the True Desolation, the forces of Odium
overran Herdaz. Herdazians have always been good
under pressure, having been challenged and conquered
so many times in their history. Many fled the country to
form resistance groups, while others remained in their
homeland, watchful for the day they can claim it back.
The famous war general, the Mink, now works closely
with Dalinar to quash Odium’s armies and to eventually
reclaim Herdaz. They’ve enlisted some of the singers
they previously enslaved to join the fight, promising the
singers emancipation in exchange for their service.
Under enemy occupation, the king takes it on himself
to personally burn a glyph in each of the 203 palace
chimneys during Unity Day. The single wisps of smoke
periodically signal the king’s devotion to his people,
as he believes war makes commoners of everyone.

## Horneater Peaks

```
Steam rises from crater lakes, whimsically drifting through
thin mountain air. Children with crowns of vermilion hair
chase each other, laughing gleefully as they claim to spot
spren among the fruit trees. Fragrant stews simmer as a
group of cooks exchange ingredients to diversify their pots.
The sun begins to set, casting a warm glow on the village,
the emerald water at its center, and the icy mountains
surrounding it. The Horneater Peaks are known for
their duality: gemlike crater lakes exuding life, heat, and
Investiture, scattered throughout an inhospitable tundra.
Situated within the borders of Jah Keved, the Horneater
Peaks are a frigid mountain-range nation that functions
independently. The Unkalaki people are vastly different
from their lowlander Veden counterparts. They take
pride in their faith, customs, and the sacred land
they inhabit.
Only the very tops of the Horneater Peaks are
habitable, and their lofty elevation protects the Unkalaki
from highstorms that leave ice fields in lower regions
of the mountains. Instead of forming a sharp point,
each mountain contains a large body of water at its
highest point. Unkalaki people refer to these crater
```

```
lakes as oceans or emerald pools. Heat rises from these
oceans, forming a warm and humid microclimate atop
each mountain. Vegetation thrives in these unique
conditions, especially along the edges of an ocean.
The heat produced by the oceans makes the Horn-
eater villages some of the warmest places on Roshar,
despite the biting cold awaiting just outside their cozy
microclimates.
```

```
Government
Each mountain is governed independently by its clan
head, called a nuatoma. Though most Unkalaki clans
are patriarchal, a few mountains are governed by
nuatomas of other genders. Most nuatomas are attended
by their family members, who take on the role of the
nuatoma’s servants.
```

```
Military
The fourth sons of the Horneater Peaks are tasked
with the protection of their people and blessed lands,
though they’re seldom called to put their training to use.
The origin myth of the Horneater Peaks suggests the
Unkalaki people were once combative but reflected and
sought a more harmonious lifestyle. They appealed to
```

**48** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
ANTHONY AVON
```

```
the gods for isolation and peace, and the gods answered
by giving them the Horneater Peaks. Occasional
skirmishes break out between warriors of neighboring
peaks, but the Unkalaki aren’t known to engage in
international warfare, and therefore they lack practical
experience in large-scale conflicts.
```

```
Villages and Hunting Grounds
Horneater villages are configured in wedge shapes
around oceans to maximize their protection from
the cold. Farming takes place inside villages. Crops
requiring the highest humidity and warmest conditions
are planted in rows closest to the shores, with more
frost-resistant crops (such as root vegetables) skirting
the outer border of the microclimate. Geese thrive in
the villages and are roasted for special occasions.
Each village has a communal expedition supply
shed located near its outer border. Villagers borrow
outerwear, footwear, and hunting equipment before
venturing into the freezing cold. The shared boots
in these sheds are known to be especially odorous.
The Unkalaki hunt chulls, which breed along
the southern slopes of the mountains; in addition
to providing meat, the chull shells and horns
are consumed as a source of supplemental
minerals. Hunting is a thrilling calling
that requires an intuitive connection
with nature to survive. Every
Unkalaki hunting party is led
by a kaluk’i’iki, an expert
huntress who thinks with
all her senses. The title
translates to “she who
the many hands of death
cannot grasp.” This
matri archal tradition
teaches girls and women
to hone their reflexes, and
above all, to trust that their
feelings are objectively informed by
a multitude of subtle signs. Kaluk’i’iki
train alone for years to earn their own
respect before asking hunters to join
them in the wilds.
```

```
Unkalaki Culture
During the Era of Solitude, singers weren’t enslaved in
the Horneater Peaks, but the humans there descended
from an ancient group of singers and humans who
commingled and bore mixed offspring. This lineage
remains evident in modern Unkalaki physiology.
Inhabitants of the Horneater Peaks are known
for their resilience, distinctive red hair, skin colors
ranging from pale to tan, and mighty statures. Due to
their singer ancestry, the Unkalaki are fortified with
resistance to poisons and toxins native to Roshar, and
they have a legendary alcohol tolerance.
Unkalaki, the official language of the Horneater
Peaks, has a musical cadence and expansive vocabulary.
The Unkalaki use poems in their naming conventions,
```

```
Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures 49
```

JULIA MADDALINA

**unkalaki couple**

```
making names lengthy. Unlike other humans, Unkalaki
can occasionally hear the rhythms of the singers.
Arguably the most remarkable feature of the
Unkalaki people is their indomitable teeth, for which
outsiders gave them the name Horneaters. These teeth
allow them to consume shells and carapaces. Foreigners
find this unnatural and off-putting, but the Unkalaki
people take it in good stride, returning their banter with
comments about how the “airsick lowlanders” are the
strange ones.
Family Structure
Unkalaki clans are usually patriarchal, and each assigns
occupations to sons based on their birth order. The
most essential jobs are given priority: First and second
sons tend crops, raise livestock, or hunt. Third sons
are craftsmen who can choose a trade to master. If
there happens to be a fourth son, they’re tasked with
becoming a warrior and protecting their clan and
nation. Since the Horneater Peaks are in a strategic
location that’s nearly impossible for an enemy army to
breach, fourth sons often train to become outstanding
soldiers but never expect to use their talents. If a son is
incapacitated, dies, or is disowned by his family, each of
his younger brothers shifts jobs to fill the missing roles.
When Unkalaki daughters come of age, they visit
the nuatoma’s spouse, who acts as an occupational
matchmaker. Roles for daughters are more open
than those of sons, and jobs are determined based
on aptitude, interest, and the village’s needs.
```

```
Religion
Nature gods account for much of the Unkalaki religious
tradition. Spren and offworld visitors are also considered
deities. The Unkalaki worship with awe and ingenuity,
believing that gods aren’t to be fought by humans, but to
be tricked whenever resolution is needed. Only a small
minority of Unkalaki practice Vorinism.
```

```
Invested Crater Lakes
Deep within each of the Unkalaki oceans, a layer
of regular water sits atop a hidden trove of liquid
Investiture. Cultivation’s Perpendicularity is in the
ocean that the Unkalaki know as the Pool. Swimming
all the way to the bottom of the Pool can transport
someone to Shadesmar, which the Unkalaki consider
the place of the gods.
```

```
Sentinels known as alaii’iku—or Sighted—are
Unkalaki people who can see spren who are normally
invisible to humans. These Sighted guard the Pool in
addition to performing their regular jobs. They are the
designated greeters for strange gods who emerge from
its waters.
Offworld Visitors
The only stable entry point for offworlders to enter
Roshar is through Cultivation’s Perpendicularity in the
Pool. When offworld visitors arrive, the Unkalaki treat
them with reverence and hospitality. Due to the thin air,
most worldhoppers prefer not to linger in the villages
for long. The only way out is down, a multi-week trek
on slick trails in freezing conditions. Kaluk’i’iki assist
these strange gods with this journey in exchange for
otherworldly gifts to share with the village’s hunters.
```

```
Resources
Farming and chull hunting are the main industries of
the Horneater Peaks. The nation’s economy is largely
closed, since transporting large quantities of produce
and animal products down steep, icy mountainsides
is neither feasible nor lucrative.
As a result, liquor is the only major export of the
Horneater Peaks. The beverage known as Horneater
white is famous for having one of the highest alcohol
concentrations of all the libations on Roshar. It can be
stored in extreme temperatures without a loss in quality.
```

```
After the Everstorm
The True Desolation broke a long history of peace
for the Unkalaki people. Moelach—the Unmade
whose presence brings the death rattles—arrived in
the Horneater Peaks, and a member of the mysterious
Diagram followed to investigate (see “The Diagram”
in chapter 5).
Jah Keved pulled rank, forcing Unkalaki fourth sons
to venture down to the lowlands to enlist with Veden
troops. Meanwhile, Unkalaki villagers began crafting
arsenals of arrows to contribute to the war efforts, and
kaluk’i’iki and their hunters prepared to defend their
villages in the absence of Unkalaki warriors.

## Iri and Rira

```
Tidereaders study the waves with reverence, discerning
signs from their momentum and crests. Cities glimmer in
the distance, promising new experiences and endless variety.
A musician sits on a rock near the shore, playing a stringed
instrument. Colorful cosmetic patterns punctuate their
golden skin, and gleaming golden hair cascades down their
back. Putting the instrument down, they bend down and
run their fingers over the sand, feeling the rocky grit scrape
their skin, followed by the gentle caress of a flowering
shrub. In Iri, life is lived with vibrant individuality so
the collective can be made whole.
In the northwestern coastal region of Roshar, the sister
nations of Iri and Rira share a warm, lush climate.
The center of their land border is broken by a gaping
body of water, which reflects the divergence between
their cultures and peoples. Iri claims Rira as part of its
kingdom, but Rira adamantly disputes this.
```

```
Iri
The capital city of Iri is Rall Elorim, the City of
Shadows. Iriali people prefer to congregate in large
cities, so most settlements throughout the land are of
an impressive size for such a small kingdom. Other
noteworthy cities include Kasitor and Eila. The primary
language spoken in Iri is Iriali.
Government
Iri is ruled by the Iriali Triumvirate which includes
a queen and two kings. Each of these monarchs has
authority over different aspects of the kingdom’s affairs.
```

```
Military
Iri has a substantial and well-trained military force.
In an effort to earn more experiences for the One
(see the upcoming “Religion” section), each new
generation that rises to military leadership intentionally
revolutionizes the operations under their command.
As a result, they excel at devising innovative combat
objectives.
```

Offworlder Heritage
Metallic golden hair and skin set the Iriali apart from
other Rosharan peoples. Their mysterious heritage
is credited to otherworldly origins. Outsiders often
attribute auspicious qualities to the golden-clad Iriali,
going as far as keeping locks of their hair for good luck—
though most Iriali are uncomfortable with this practice
and consider it objectifying.
```

```
Iriali Culture
Iri has a proud culture of exploration and movement.
Social customs usually stem from the Iriali religious
tradition of the Long Trail. Loved ones greet each other
by asking, “How is the journey for you?” Occupations
that focus on journeying are valued highly by the Iriali.
Cobblers are especially beloved, as practical footwear
is a hallmark of readiness. Nearly all Iriali prepare
travel packs and three months of provisions so if the
call comes, they’ll be ready to leave for their next world
at a moment’s notice.
Among cosmere scholars, there’s some debate
about whether the Iriali are actually human, but most
Rosharans consider them humans and often refer to
them as such.
```

```
The Iriali paint their skin in geometric patterns with
bright colors to contrast with their monochromatic
features. Stylishly draped wraps in gauzy, breathable
fabrics are commonly worn by all genders, styled
differently depending on regional traditions. Pastel
fabrics are very much in vogue and contribute to the
Iriali’s ethereal reputation. Working-class men opt
for smock-like garments paired with belts to allow for
more mobility.
Religion
Most ethnic Iriali worship the One, a holy being whom
they believe fragmented into countless mortal bodies to
learn about the cosmere. The Iriali believe they’re all
parts of the One and will be reunited someday to merge
their experiences into a single omniscient collective.
To achieve this, they must live highly individualistic
lives and gain as many insights as possible. Flowing
from this faith, the Iriali celebrate diversity in identities
and lifestyles. Since they’re all made from the same
being and will return to it, their differences bring them
closer to each other and to achieving a full spectrum of
understanding.
```

**52** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
JULIA MADDALINA
```

The Iriali claim that Roshar is the fourth world that
their ancestors arrived on during the Long Trail—their
as-yet-unfinished journey of seven worlds. Once their
people reach the seventh world, they expect to be
reunited as the One. As the Iriali don’t know the time
of their destined departure from Roshar and migration
to the Fifth Land, they must remain ever vigilant and
prepared to leave at a moment’s notice.
Though most Iriali believe in the Long Trail and the
reunification of the One, their society isn’t monolithic.
Some are less scrupulous about their religious views,
and others don’t believe at all, but even among these,
the need for preparedness is widely accepted.
The Iriali faith also greatly esteems portents, and
tidereaders study the waves to predict the future.

Resources
Farming and travel goods are major industries in Iri.
Edible flowers, root vegetables, and mushrooms can
be cultivated or foraged for in rural areas. Fisherfolk
harvest seafood in abundance along the coast of the
Reshi Sea, including saltwater cremlings, crabs, and
small fish. From the body of water shared with Rira,
their harvest includes large, fatty fish and a water
vegetable known as dripgrass.

Oathgate
An Oathgate stands in the center of the vast reservoir
in Iri’s capital, Rall Elorim, the City of Shadows.

Rira

Constantly at odds with Iri, Rira is struggling to
maintain its sovereignty. Cultural elements from Iri
and the Reshi Isles have influenced modern Riran
society. The primary language spoken in Rira is Riran,
which shares many similarities with the Iriali and Reshi
languages.

Government
A queen rules over Rira. The Iriali monarchs
refer to her as their daughter to delegitimize Rira’s
independence, though she’s older than all of them
and they share no blood relation. She has no known
children, and she refuses to marry in the hope someone
will trade a Shardblade for her hand.

Riran Culture
Rirans are kindly people who express affection openly,
and it’s common to see couples holding hands or kissing
in public. In Rira, men often go bare-chested and opt
for waist wraps similar to the styles worn in Iri. Women’s
shirts are generally sleeveless, cropped above their
navels, and paired with billowing skirts.

```
Humans of the Iriali and Riran ethnicities are known
for being tall with light skin and blond hair, but their
genetic similarities end there. Rirans generally lack the
metallic hue of the Iriali, and they’re more ethnically
similar to the Shin.
Religion
Some aspects of Iriali culture have spread to Rira,
such as belief in the One, but they’re not mainstream.
Rirans have their own religious beliefs, and those who
accept the One typically do so within their broader
understanding of cosmology, sometimes including the
Heralds and the Almighty. Rirans are often superstitious
and practice rituals such as rubbing a stone over their
bodies once a month to oust bad memories hiding in
their skin.
```

```
Sovereignty
Iri’s claim on Rira is salt in a perpetually bleeding
wound. Some Riran historians believe their ancestors
inhabited both Iri and Rira as one kingdom before the
Iriali arrived and forced the Rirans from the kingdom’s
western flank. During the Silver Kingdoms era, the
sister nations were ruled by Iri, but Rira has since
broken off.
Tensions also brew on the massive lake between
Iri and Rira. Both nations rely on fish as a food source.
Iri claims Riran fisherfolk are purposely overfishing,
while Rira accuses Iri of expanding its water border
past where the land border indicates is fair.
Military
Rira’s military exists only to fend off Iri’s. Military
spies identify weak points in Iri’s troops and pass the
information along to strategists who advise Riran
generals. Their soldiers are fewer in number and lack
the fancy equipment of the Iriali, but when provoked,
they know how to hit their neighbor where it hurts.
```

```
Resources
Farming, fishing, and mining account for much of
Rira’s economy. Tourism in the alluring sunken forests
attracts Rirans, Iriali, Reshi, and even visitors from
Babatharnam.
Rira once had a set of Shardplate, but the nation
lost it after a noblewoman named Evi fled to Alethkar
to court Dalinar Kholin.

After the Everstorm
The enslaved singers in Iri and Rira awakened in the
Everstorm, unprepared to face the onslaught of human
opinions about their fate. Some singers believed in the
One worshipped by most humans of Iri and Rira; many
of these humans were wililng to accept the singers into
their religious narrative, so some singers aspired to join
human religious communities. Other singers sought
their own gods for guidance. Rira exiled the singers
of their nation immediately, sending them across the
border to Iri. Meanwhile, Iriali singers who transformed
into mediationform sought audience with the monarchy.
They argued that the land was rightfully theirs and that
the Iriali were merely visitors.
The Iriali, looking to their belief that Roshar is
merely one step in their Long Trail, acknowledged the
singers as the rightful stewards of the land. This began
a process of peaceful surrender—but it was complicated
by the arrival of the Fused, who commanded awakened
singers to join Odium’s forces. After the Fused took
control of Iri’s military, an army of combined human
and singer forces overtook Rira, which by extension,
became part of Odium’s territory. In the wake of the
Battle of Thaylen Field, Iri continued its conquests,
turning an eye to the Purelake and surrounding nations.
```

```
Iriali and Riran Singers
Iri dates back to the Silver Kingdoms era. During the
Desolations, it was held more often by singers than
humans. Its capital, Rall Elorim, exchanged hands
many times and still includes examples of ancient
singer architecture.
During the Era of Solitude, ethnic Iriali people
never fully embraced the Rosharan custom of exploiting
enslaved singers. Older Iriali took little interest in
singers, while some younger Iriali speculated singers
might be part of the One and should be allowed to
live more varied lives as unique contributors.
Of all the nations on Roshar that enslaved singers,
Iri is the only one where humans and singers achieved
peace after the Everstorm. This didn’t stop Iriali singers
from feeling bitterness and despair at memories of
enslavement, but the singers of Iri are working to build
new lives.
Having made peace with the Iriali humans, the
land’s stewards aren’t as eager to accept Odium’s gifts.
They accepted his aid and marched to liberate singers
in Rira, but many remain skeptical of the Fused. Some
singers even work with humans to resist Odium in
Rall Elorim (described in chapter 6).
```

## Jah Keved.

```
A city square bustles as various languages chorus in the
background. A group of wealthy women pause to inspect
a pamphlet of havah styles, then they pursue the sweet
aroma of lunch offerings from an upscale restaurant.
A chull wagon struggles to navigate the busy streets.
Its driver narrows his eyes at the constant foot traffic,
only to switch to a polite nod as two ardents cross his path.
Jah Keved is a modern kingdom with religion at its heart
and ambition in its nature.
Second only in size to Alethkar, Jah Keved is a nation
in the central eastern region of Roshar. It is verdant with
a fairly temperate climate. The Veden people aren’t as
emotionally reserved as their Alethi neighbors, but they
consider themselves an emblem of Vorinism and adhere
strictly to its tenets.
Sweeping hills cover the borderlands that separate
Jah Keved from the warlike Alethi people, whom
Jah Keved has provoked in the past through border
skirmishes. Despite their competitive nature, the two
Vorin nations are mostly affable, and it’s not uncommon
for members of their nobility to intermarry.
```

```
Government
A king rules from Jah Keved’s capital city of Vedenar.
Highprinces hold regional territory and serve under the
king; this governing body closely resembles Alethkar’s.
Some Veden highprincedoms are Valam, Abrial, Boriar,
Evinor, and Jal Mala.
Jah Keved was once the largest kingdom on Roshar,
but it lost this claim after the princedoms of Alethkar
unified under King Gavilar and established that nation’s
modern borders.
```

**54** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
MARIE SEEBERGER
```

```
Military
Jah Keved has an extensive military force with
well-constructed fortifications, and each highprince
maintains their own army. Though the Alethi are
famous for having the most ferocious soldiers, Veden
soldiers are considered very capable, and Veden generals
are expert strategists. They utilize relatively small raider
armies, quickly dispatching them to gain an advantage
on the battlefield before larger armies are brought in.
```

```
Veden Culture
Historically, the inhabitants of Jah Keved have included
multiple human ethnic groups and a large population
of enslaved singers. Much like in Alethkar and Khar-
branth, the lighteyes are the ruling class of Jah Keved,
with the darkeyes facing discrimination.
```

```
Ethnic Groups
Jah Keved has four main ethnic groups. Vedens are
the largest and control the government, but the other
ethnic groups have been able to maintain their
ancestral lands.
Veden
The ethnic majority in Jah Keved, Vedens are
known for having light tan skin and violet eyes.
They can have a variety of hair colors, usually
black but occasionally including red,
hinting at ties to the Unkalaki people of
the Horneater Peaks.
The Veden language is very similar
to Alethi due to its Vorin roots, and
people from both lands can typically
understand each other. Vedens
generally treat ardents with the
utmost respect, relying on them for
their worship.
Siln
The people of Silnasen don’t
care to keep up with the latest
advancements of the world. Their
land was once a dynastic city-state,
and though they’re now under Jah
Keved’s rule, they continue their
traditions of hunting and gathering.
They speak the Siln language. Siln
people typically have tan skin and
medium-to-dark hair.
```

```
Bav
Bavland has its own borders and functions
independently from the rest of Jah Keved. It’s known for
being dusty and rich in natural minerals and ores, and
most Bav men hold occupations relating to the mining
industry. The Bav speak a language of their own, which
includes multiple dialects. Like the Siln, the Bav people
generally have tan skin and medium-to-dark hair.
Most households have a closed porch with a washing
basin; here, family members are expected to wash before
entering the living area. The Bav consider it unlucky
to be the last one to return home—likely because the
water in the washbasin gets murkier with each arrival.
If an important guest visits a Bav household, it’s polite
for the host to insist they need not wash before entering,
and after the visit, to avoid disturbing any resulting dust
or debris for ten days.
```

Unkalaki
Although their territory is within the borders of
Jah Keved, the Unkalaki people of the Horneater
Peaks consider themselves independent (see the
earlier “Horneater Peaks” section). They have singer
ancestry, which impacts their physiology and culture
in unique ways.
```

```
Family Structure
In Veden society, sons are given two names. The first
name signifies their birth order, beginning with Nan,
Tet, Asha, and Van for the first four sons. The second is
their given name. If a son dies or is disowned, the first
names of younger sons are moved up to close the gap.
Children of other genders only receive a given name
without regard for their birth order.
Surnames are kept for a lifetime, so married couples
usually have two different surnames. When children
are born, they take the surname of their parent who is
ranked most highly in the Vorin caste system. If both
parents are of equal social class, the child is given their
father’s surname.
```

```
Religion
Most people in Jah Keved practice Vorinism, the
official religion of their kingdom. Major cities in Jah
Keved contain at least one temple for each Herald, and
ardents are esteemed more highly in Jah Keved than
in most other nations. The people of Jah Keved tend
to view their nation as more devout and righteous than
any other.
The Holy Enclave, the center of the Vorin faith, is
located in the city of Valath. Meanwhile, the capital city
of Vedenar is known for its temples that represent every
devotary in the Vorin church, even smaller orders such
as the Devotary of Sincerity.
```

```
Resources
Jah Keved boasts a large collection of Shardblades,
second only to Alethkar. The Veden agricultural
industry is fairly robust, and Vedenar is an important
port city. Religious resources related to Vorinism are in
abundance in Jah Keved, and the city of Valath is home
to a major spanreed hub.
```

```
Oathgate
An Oathgate stands in Vedenar, the capital of
Jah Keved.
```

```
After the Everstorm
Jah Keved experienced enormous changes in the couple
of years leading up to the True Desolation. The Veden
civil war deeply wounded the nation following King
Hanavanar’s assassination, just as intended by the
Diagram. In the ensuing power vacuum, several factions
competed to seize the throne. The Unmade Nergaoul
stoked the flames of insurrection with the Thrill. Any
sense of patriotism failed as previously allied armies
turned on each other with inflated bloodlust. King
Valam won—only to name Taravangian his heir just
before he died.
The beginning of the True Desolation spelled the end
of Veden independence. As the king of Kharbranth and
the new king of Jah Keved, Taravangian commanded the
Veden forces. He directed Jah Keved to openly support
the Coalition of Monarchs—but behind the scenes,
he maneuvered Jah Keved to switch sides, appointing
leaders ready to betray Dalinar and serve Odium.
```

```
Veden Singers
Enslaved singers in Jah Keved shared a similar life style to
their Alethi counterparts. They lived in the background
of society, even when they worked in the heart of a big
city, never truly seen and always pushed to their limits.
When the Everstorm awakened Veden singers,
they immediately rebelled. Some employed guerrilla
tactics they had observed during Jah Keved’s civil
war, while others withdrew to the countryside. After a
counterattack by the Veden military, most singers were
driven into Alethkar.
Veden singers are more likely than most singers to
adopt elements of Vorin culture—such as praying to
the Almighty or wearing safehand gloves—though the
Fused punish such behavior. Veden singers are also
among the most eager to join Odium’s forces. Many of
them have joined larger armies in Alethkar, while others
joined the invasion of Thaylen City.
```

```
He tried to put all of that out of his mind as
he toured Vedenar, one of the great cities of
the world, known for its amazing gardens
and lush atmosphere. Unfortunately, the
city had been deva stated by the Veden civil
war, then the subsequent arrival of the
Everstorm. Even along the sanitized path
he walked for the tour, they passed scorched
buildings, piles of rubble.

She could hear the bells already, tinkling
in the wind, ringing with pure voices.
She had to strain her neck to look up
toward the city’s loftiest rim; Kharbranth
was like a mountain towering over her.
```

## Kharbranth and the Frostlands

```
Bells ring to signal the hour. Laborers weave through busy
streets, hefting bundles of merchandise on their shoulders.
The bitter perfume of medicinal herbs lingers near an
apothecary, causing a passing Makabaki sailor to wrinkle
his nose. Parshmen carefully slather periwinkle paint on a
brick building as their taskmaster stops a peddler for some
spicy boiled cremlings. Kharbranth brims with culture,
movement, and a zest for discovery.
The independent city-state of Kharbranth is located on
the westernmost tip of the Frostlands in southeastern
Roshar. Long ago, it began as a pirate town on a
sheltered harbor, then developed over decades into
a kingdom.
The mountain enveloping the city offers significant
shelter from highstorms. Bells throughout the city are
said to warn citizens of approaching highstorms since
the winds are often too gentle to signal the storm’s
arrival. These bells also ring to announce the passage of
time, earning Kharbranth the nickname of City of Bells.
```

```
Government
King Taravangian rules over Kharbranth as a seemingly
benevolent monarch. He endeared his subjects to him by
visiting hospitals and comforting patients. However, his
subjects can’t see the truth of who he has become. After
visiting the Nightwatcher in a desperate attempt to help
save Roshar, Taravangian isn’t only the compassionate
steward the world sees, but behind closed doors, a
scheming tyrant.
The royal colors of Kharbranth are burnt orange
and white, which the world has come to associate
with surgeons and healing thanks to the city-state’s
unparalleled hospitals.
A long-standing right-of-migration law allows
human immigrants to enter and leave Kharbranth at
will, lending the city a distinctly cosmopolitan feel.
```

```
Military
Kharbranth doesn’t maintain a formidable army
or navy, though they have a small force of trained
soldiers and the ability to requisition a naval fleet
of merchant ships if the need presents itself. This
approach serves as a strategic deterrent: by remaining
vulnerable but adding significant value to the world’s
medical advancements and care, any invaders would
subject themselves to the scorn of the international
communit y.
Kharbranth has historically avoided conflict with
other nations, and the nation has been known to deploy
surgeons to tend to the wounded on both sides of
international wars it’s not directly involved in.

Kharbranthian Culture

The city-state is densely populated by a diverse
patchwork of people. Humans from all over Roshar
live as neighbors in the port city. Enslaved singers
toil throughout the steep roads, hauling goods and
rickshaws, though human slavery is forbidden by
t he monarchy.
Kharbranth has a bustling nightlife. While its
offerings are tame in nature, one can easily shop or go
to a restaurant for soup late at night. It’s not uncommon
for people to visit Kharbranth for business or pleasure,
then end up staying for its many amenities.
Humans of the Kharbranthian ethnic group are
similar to the Veden, Bav, and Alethi people. They
have tan skin and dark hair, and they commonly speak
Kharbranthian, a Vorin dialect. Immigrants from across
Roshar are commonplace.

Caste System
The Vorin social castes of lighteyes and darkeyes
determine a human’s general lot in life, but less so than
in nations such as Alethkar and Jah Keved. Public
services like free healthcare are available to all humans,
not only to the privileged lighteyes. Immigrants from
non-Vorin nations are assigned a caste and rank based
first on their eye shade, then with consideration for their
level of wealth and their career.
People who come from nations that don’t factor eye
color into status tend to find this practice insulting.
Many who would be equivalent to a third or fourth
dahn in their homeland are merely given first nahn in
Kharbranth. This has led to a huge wealth disparity
within the first nahn, since one person with the
rank might be a huntmaster, while another could
be foreign nobility.

City Layout
Crem, daub, and mud are popular building materials
in Kharbranth. Colors are used to identify buildings:
for example, green denotes a restaurant, violet is used
for textile shops, and pastel colors are reserved for
domiciles. The most common building colors are red
and orange. Blue and yellow are used sparingly, creating
exquisite accents when the city is viewed from afar.
Due to the slope of the city, chull wagons can’t
effectively navigate the streets, so merchants pay
darkeyed runners to transport their goods from the
docks to the marketplace. Most people walk the busy
streets, but rickshaws and palanquins are available to
the wealthy. Gravity allows the distribution of running
water through an advanced plumbing system.

```
Medical Prowess
Advancements in the field of medicine often originate
in Kharbranth. Students from all over Roshar take
demanding entry exams and pay exorbitant tuition to
train as surgeons at the Great Concourse of Kharbranth.
Hospitals are open to the public for treatment of
physical and mental illnesses. There is no charge for
treatment, as the hospitals are fully funded by revenue
from the Palanaeum.
```

```
Religion
Most citizens of Kharbranth either practice Vorinism
or hide their fringe religious views. Publicly criticizing
the Vorin church is considered a social infraction.
```

```
The Conclave
Built into the mountain, the Conclave sits proudly
at the top of the city, and its brightly painted domed
roofs can be easily spotted by ships approaching the
port of Kharbranth. This official city building includes
the royal palace, a luxurious guest wing for important
visitors, beautiful gardens, and the library known as the
Palanaeum. Heatrials—heat-producing fabrials—are
used to warm water as it runs through the Conclave’s
plumbing system. Guests often find it hard to leave
once they’ve experienced the comforts of Kharbranth’s
scientific advancements.
Though the surrounding mountain protects the
city from highstorms, the force of the storms breaking
against the mountain can cause damage within
the Conclave.
```

```
The Palanaeum
Roshar’s largest library resides within the Conclave.
Admission to the Palanaeum is expensive, as the
library holds over seven hundred thousand texts
and is diligently staffed by ardents.
The royal treasury is incorporated into the
Palanaeum itself: glowing emeralds light every
row of the library’s shelves.
```

```
Resources
There are hardly any natural resources of value in
or around the port city. Kharbranth’s economy relies
on international trade, as without it, the city couldn’t
sustain itself.
```

Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures 59
```

```
After the Everstorm
Unbeknownst to all but a small group of advisors,
King Taravangian used his boon from the Nightwatcher
to form the Diagram, a prophetic design for saving his
people. He also built a secret organization to bring the
Diagram’s machinations to fruition (see “The Diagram”
in chapter 5). After sending Szeth to assassinate world
leaders, Taravangian claimed the Veden throne. During
the Everstorm, Taravangian entered into a private
agreement to serve Odium so long as the hateful god
spared Kharbranth from the coming destruction.
To protect Kharbranth from his sins against the
rest of humanity, King Taravangian distanced himself
from his inner circle. He later abdicated the throne
to his daughter, Queen Savrahalidem, whom he kept
completely ignorant of his designs. Once his treachery
was revealed, he stood alone, just as he’d planned.
```

```
Kharbranthian Singers
Due to Kharbranth’s concentration of wealth and its
rejection of human slavery, the city-state had one of the
highest concentrations of enslaved singers on Roshar.
They were consigned to monotonous drudgery as
porters, laborers, and lift attendants.
Just before the Everstorm, King Taravangian ordered
Kharbranth’s enslaved singers to be taken away from
the city. Some were sent aboard ships to the Frostlands;
when they awakened, these singers found themselves in
unfamiliar lands with no connections or resources. Some
slave masters ignored the king’s eccentric order; the
singers they had enslaved met a worse fate, as the city’s
militia sought and murdered each awakened singer.
```

```
Frostlands
Subject to severe highstorm exposure, the Frostlands
of southern Roshar remain largely ungoverned. The
Unclaimed Hills in the upper Frostlands stretch from
the eastern border of Alethkar to the Ocean of Origins.
```

```
New Natanan
The small Vorin nation of New Natanan perches on the
shores of the Ocean of Origins. The Natan people are
known for having pale blue-tinted skin and white hair.
This city-state is a vital location for announcing
highstorms to the rest of Roshar, as the storms strike
here first. Ships often stop at its docks to regroup, and
the Natan port serves as an active trade hub.
Shattered Plains
South of the Unclaimed Hills lie the Shattered Plains,
a historically significant and geologically distinct area
described in the “Shattered Plains” section of chapter 6.
```

```
Southern Frostlands
Plagued by bandits and military deserters, the southern
Frostlands are generally best avoided. Merchants travel
through this territory when they must, but they tend
to be skittish about it. Regardless of the dangers, it’s
a popular route for slave traders.
Unclaimed Hills
The Unclaimed Hills range greatly in size; some are tall
and steep, while others are short and rounded. Coarse
grass covers the hills, each blade retracting into the
rocky ground when a highstorm hits. Rockbuds and
other flora that grow well elsewhere are measly in stature
here. Cremlings hide for prolonged periods of time, only
emerging from their shelters to hydrate after highstorms.
Listeners once lived in the greater Unclaimed
Hills, but they have since congregated deep within the
Shattered Plains. Small camps of Natan people reside
in the hills, but they are few and far between.

## Purelake and Environs

_Fisherfolk test their footing as they wade farther into calm,
shallow waters. Sunlight beats down on their bare shoulders
like a soothing drum. In the distance, fish dance, springing
from the water and diving back in with vigor and grace.
Time passes indiscernibly. A fisher stumbles into a sinkhole,
reluctantly exclaiming praises to Vun Makak for granting
him the misfortune—as it was surely the god’s will. The
water shimmers incessantly in the late afternoon sun, and
the fisherfolk keep to their work. The Purelake is known
for tranquility, anchoring its people in the present._
Steeping in the central western region of Roshar, the
Purelake is a shallow, expansive body of water. Fish are
plentiful, and superstitious Purelakers claim that some
have special properties. Surrounding lands whose shores
dip into the Purelake also share in the bounty of fish
along their coasts.

```
Government
In the Purelake, autonomous villages exist in place of a
universal government. They are peaceful and generally
disinterested in foreign affairs. The region has no official
military force, though villages raise militias during times
of crisis.
```

```
Ecology
Cultivation’s influence is believed to contribute to
the Purelake’s resilience and abundant life. Fish,
cremlings, and riverspren inhabit the pristine waters.
Warm and mild, the Purelake’s climate is comfortable
and consistent, though it grows colder during its
relatively gentle highstorms. Water in the Purelake
drains into sinkholes during highstorms, and it can’t
be permanently corrupted by human waste, as it’s
periodically cleansed through the storms.
```

```
Selay Culture
Most humans living in the Purelake region belong to
the Selay ethnic group that has been in the Purelake for
centuries. The Selay people have dark hair and bronze
skin, sometimes marked by subtle ripple patterns. The
Selay believe sunlight is important to their health. Men
typically go shirtless and wear short pants and sandals,
while women wear simple chest wraps and short skirts.
Purelakers speak Selay, which is similar to Iriali,
Reshi, and other languages in northwestern Roshar.
Fishing is the most common occupation among the
Selay, and they use rafts as carts to carry belongings
over the water. Purelaker architecture styles are inspired
by the rounded forms of rockbuds.
Time is relative in the Purelake. Just as the waters are
calm and in no short supply, time is seen as abundant.
The Selay don’t like to be rushed, as the feeling is for-
eign to them. They trade through giving and receiving
gifts or favors.
Selay people are highly superstitious. They believe
the future can sometimes be read through the tides,
similar to the Iriali tidereaders.
```

```
Religion
The Selay believe in brother gods called Nu Ralik and
Vun Makak. They worship the upright brother, Nu
Ralik—but never openly, lest they draw the ire of his
jealous brother. Therefore, the Selay pretend to venerate
Vun Makak and encourage his ego by permitting him to
punish and curse them. Meanwhile, they save worship
of their true god, Nu Ralik, for holy grottos alone.
```

```
Resources
Fish and water vegetables are the primary natural
resources of the Purelake. The Selay people believe
certain fish possess magical properties. Kolgril are lucky
fish which, when eaten, supposedly cure aching joints for
a month—and can sometimes allow the eater to read the
clouds and predict the visit of friends. Minnows, stumpy
cort, and spikemane also populate the Purelake.
```

```
Environs
Four nations border the Purelake: Marabethia,
Babatharnam, Yulay, and Tu Bayla. The people of these
nations have similar ethnic heritages to the Selay, and
most have dark hair and bronze skin. They usually speak
a mix of Selay and local tribal languages.
```

```
The Purelake seemed to extend forever,
wide as an ocean. Szeth’s steps startled
schools of fish, which would follow behind
him for a bit, occasionally nipping at
his boots. Gnarled trees poked from
the shallows, gorging themselves on
the water while their roots grasped the
many holes and furrows in the lake
bed. Rock outcrops broke the lake near
the coast, but inward the Purelake
grew placid, more empty.
```

**62** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
ADAM J. MARIN
```

Marabethia
Dividing the Purelake and the Reshi Isles, Marabethia
is a land of big opinions and irreverent consequences.
Yu-nerig, large oceanic greatshells, live off the coast
of Marabethia. They have gemhearts and are fit for
human consumption. When criminals commit grievous
crimes, lawkeepers hang them over a coastal cliff as
yu-nerig bait. Surviving for a full week grants the
criminal impunity—but such a feat is inconceivable.
Debate is a favorite pastime of the Marabethian
people, and city pedestals are open for public use.
Citizens can voice their opinions about controversial
topics, drawing cheers from those who agree—and
rotten fruit from those who don’t.
A secret Skybreaker stronghold is located near the
northern reaches of the Purelake, and the Marabethian
government occasionally calls on them for assistance.

Babatharnam
The nation of Babatharnam stands between Rira,
Marabethia, and Yulay. Its people place great value on
thoughtful and precise communication. This sometimes
leads to misunderstandings and offense from careless
outsiders.
A tradition of crowning the oldest living man king
has inadvertently placed an expiration date on the male
citizens of Babatharnam. The current Monavakah
Dynasty protects its status in the nation by exiling
any man old enough to challenge its kings. Anyone
who refuses to leave or who challenges them for the
throne is immediately executed by assassins. While the
Monavakah Dynasty has ruled for fifty years, whispers
of rebellions grow too frequent to ignore.

**Oathgate**
The capital city of Babatharnam, Panatham, contains
an Oathgate.

Yulay
Situated between the Purelake and Azir, Yulay acts as
a bridge to the Makabaki region. A natural opening in
the mountain range along its southern border connects
it to the Azish Empire. Yulay has two towns in this
region, Benru and Berqq, which serve as the hub of
Yulay’s trade with Azir. The people of Yulay were once
concerned Azir would try to invade them to gain access
to the Purelake, but they’ve since become confident the
Azish Empire has no interest in doing so.
The people of Yulay prize the traits of hopefulness
and patience. They’ve long believed the Knights
Radiant would return.

```
Tu Bayla
With the Purelake at its western border and Jah Keved
to the east, Tu Bayla has a unique vantage point for
the bordering nations’ drastically different lifestyles.
Its people live in nomadic tribes and subsist on fish
from the Purelake and the Reshi Sea, along with wild
vegetation. Each tribe employs interpreters who speak
multiple tribal languages, Selay, and either Veden or
a Bav dialect.
Some tribes have superstitions about preserving fish
from the Purelake, believing that fish must be eaten
fresh; preserving excess for later is considered stealing.
```

```
After the Everstorm
Just before the Everstorm, a deadly plague swept across
the Purelake. (Unbeknownst to the Purelakers, this
virus was brought by worldhoppers who called it the
“common cold.”)
Still reeling from this plague in the Everstorm’s wake,
rumors spread among the Selay people, as they accused
the storm of stealing the luck of their magical fish. As
the True Desolation took hold, however, this turned
out to be the least of their problems. Having lived in
peace for generations, the Selay were unprepared for
the malice of the Fused.
Once Iri surrendered to Odium’s forces, the nation
moved to conquer much of the Purelake and its
environs. The Fused have stationed a few of their Regals
in the area, though they are more concerned with their
advancing troops than with the territory itself.
```

```
“There is a great deal of unrest in
Babatharnam. It was dangerous to
visit when we did. The Monavakahs
make very certain that their family
members live the longest; for fifty years,
no one outside their family has become
M o s t A n c i e n t .”
```

Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures 63

Government
The Reshi Isles each have their own monarch and a
small force of capable soldiers. Ral-na, king of the Tai-na
“island” called Relu-na, is a Knight Radiant whose body
was healed to match his true gender through Stormlight.
```

```
Tai-na
Tai-na are ancient sapient greatshells who grow to
startling sizes due to their aquatic habitat and ability to
bond spren. The Reshi people call the Tai-na “islands”
and have taken up residence on them accordingly. It’s
estimated a hundred Tai-na roam the Reshi Sea, with
tens of them inhabited by small Reshi civilizations.
Each Tai-na has an enormous back with a mountain-
ous, jagged carapace that grows taller toward the center
of their back. They have a crustacean-like appearance
thanks to their gigantic mandibles and mouth, eyes the
```

## Reshi Isles

_Light rainfall shrouds the beach in mist. Merchants
relax in the sea’s swaying embrace after a day of fierce
negotiations. A group of carpenters shed their clothes and
run into the water, rinsing sawdust from their faces and
eyes. Local cooks carry firewood onto the beach, then
begin roasting meat to serve to patrons returning from the
waves. Children help rotate the spit, anticipating a reward
of mashed fruit and oily meat. One child gasps and jumps
excitedly, pointing at two faraway “islands” that are
about to collide. The Reshi Isles are equal parts bliss
and boredom—at least, when the Tai-na play nice._
Scattered along the northern cap of Roshar, the Reshi
Isles sit near the equator, warm and thick with humidity.
At times, the mist grows so dense, it’s hard to see any-
thing. Some of the smaller Reshi Isles aren’t isles at all,
but massive greatshells called Tai-na.

```

size of houses, and legs longer than sixty feet. Their feet
reach the bottom of the ocean, which they traverse at a
leisurely pace.
A Tai-na’s back rises hundreds of feet above the
water, providing steep yet usable land with a thick cover
of bountiful jungle terrain. At the top of their head
grows a meadow of rockbuds.
Most Tai-na are large enough to host small villages
or entire towns on their backs. To make climbing up
the island more feasible, the Reshi carve stairs into the
carapace of the Tai-na’s back—an act that doesn’t affect
the longevity of the Tai-na.
In general, Tai-na make excellent islands for the
Reshi. However, these greatshells are sapient beings with
minds of their own. If two Tai-na wander too close to
each other, the outcome is unpredictable. Most of the
time, everything is fine and the islands get along—but
sometimes, they instead go to war. When two Tai-na
clash, the Reshi who live on them participate in a limited
capacity. A monarch and soldiers confront their peers
on the opposing Tai-na, but their goal is more rooted in
intimidation than bloodshed. The bolder warriors are
deemed victorious.
```

```
While these interactions aren’t generally very
dangerous, some Reshi find them exceedingly annoying.
While their gods, the islands, wage war, the Reshi
must simply tag along for the ride. Once the islands are
done quarreling, they go their separate ways, and their
inhabitants resume their normal lives. People who find
this occasional process too upsetting usually emigrate
to the larger, stationary Reshi islands or to other coastal
nations like Marabethia.
```

```
Reshi Culture
The population of the Reshi Isles is predominantly
human. Though enslaved singers work at major tourist
destinations on stationary islands, they don’t live on any
of the Tai-na islands.
Ethnically Reshi people have brown skin, black hair,
and round faces. They speak the Reshi language in
abrupt, medium- to high-pitched vocalizations. Many
islands supplement their communication with dynamic
hand gestures; Azish scholars believe these are abbrev-
iated derivatives of an ancient sign language lost to time.
```

```
Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures 65
```

ANTHONY AVON (LEFT); JULIA MADDALINA (RIGHT)

```
Many Reshi people savor the rush of a challenge.
Bartering makes for fun competition, and it’s consid-
ered both an act of commerce and a celebrated social
pastime. Reshi take pride in what they do, balancing
ambition, cleverness, and consideration for others.
Conflict is generally playful and short-lived.
Fashion is of little use to most Reshi, and the hot
weather makes excess decorative fabric impractical.
Monarchs of the islands may wear swathing robes, but
citizens tend to favor lightweight clothing woven from
grass, simple vests, and tasseled waist wraps. Reshi
soldiers wear crustacean breastplates and claw-like
armguards.
Nudity isn’t inherently sexualized in the Reshi Isles.
Going topless is acceptable for people of all genders,
and anyone can swim in the sea completely naked.
```

```
Tourism
Foreigners travel to the Reshi Isles for many reasons,
most commonly to leave behind complex worries and
live a simple, relaxing life. Most outsiders aren’t aware
many of the islands are greatshells until they arrive.
Some visitors become so fond of slow-paced life atop
the islands that they never leave. This often requires
them to exchange their wealth and belongings for
permanent residency. Every monarch has their own
requirements and customs concerning immigration.
```

```
Religion
Reshi worship the Tai-na as gods and feed them fruit
offerings by lowering the fruit with ropes. Each Tai-na
bonds a spren, which Reshi people consider the soul
of their god island. Out of reverence, the Reshi don’t
speak of this to foreigners.
Believing bold behavior is rewarded by their gods,
the Reshi strive to be fearless and resolute in all they do.
```

```
Resources
The Reshi feed themselves through hunting, fishing,
and gathering. Their economy isn’t centrally organized
or regulated.
Reshi people are largely unaware of current events
and economic conditions on mainland Roshar. Excess
goods are traded to foreign merchants, who the Reshi
rely on for essential resources that they lack raw
materials for (such as medicine). However, the Reshi
don’t trust foreign merchants easily, due to trading with
predatory ones in the past. Instead, they prefer to build
trust with repeat visitors.
```

```
After the Everstorm
With the coming of the True Desolation, the Reshi Isles
feel the attention of world powers on them for the first
time in millennia. With much of northern Roshar falling
to Odium’s control, the threat of nationwide occupation
looms ever closer. The Reshi Isles may lack an Oathgate,
but Odium’s goal of global conquest includes every
nation on Roshar.
```

```
Reshi Singers
The enslaved singers of the Reshi Isles lived on the
larger islands, primarily working as farmers, gatherers,
dock laborers, and porters for visiting tourists.
Newly awakened singers left their lives of slavery
with relief and a shared dream. Banding together, they
took control of a sparsely populated island and turned it
into a sanctuary. There, singers can heal and regroup,
living quiet, leisurely lives without serving another spe-
cies. So far, these singers have escaped the notice of the
Fused, and the Reshi humans have not pursued them.

```
Millennia ago, Shinovar attempted to invade other
parts of Roshar but eventually turned to isolationism.
Most recently, the Shin armies fought one another in a
brief civil war led by Szeth-son-Neturo, an Honorbearer
who believed the Voice to be one of the Unmade. After
Szeth was declared Truthless and exiled from Shinovar,
Shin soldiers have seen no major conflicts.
```

```
Shin Culture
All people living within Shinovar are human. Ethnically
Shin people are shorter than most humans on Roshar
and remain very close in appearance to their ancient
ancestors. They lack epicanthic folds on their eyes,
a feature that some foreigners describe as imparting a
youthful or eager look. Their skin tones vary widely,
including the tans and browns found in other parts of
the world, but they’re the only nation on Roshar where
pale, pink-tinged skin is commonplace.
The people of Shinovar speak the Shin language,
which diverged long ago from other languages on
Roshar and thus differs greatly from them. The Shin
people value honesty, humility, and actions that “add”
by bringing life or beauty into the world. However, their
isolated culture leads to fear and distrust of outsiders,
whom they call stonewalkers.
```

## Shinovar

```
A shepherd peers up at the sky and adjusts the bright
green handkerchief covering her hair, trying to determine
whether the gentle rainfall is from a highstorm or a regular
storm. As the droplets grow bigger and more urgent, she
walks back to her house to enjoy a meal before returning
to work. Grassy fields remain indifferent, absorbing
the water without so much as a grateful twitch. Inside
the house, another woman in a crisp white apron leans
out the window to cast grains of wheat for her chickens.
They cluck greedily as they eat, then stalk away in search
of tiny creatures emerging from the damp soil. Shinovar is
a sheltered land of rich agriculture and innocuous weather.
Crescent mountain ranges protect Shinovar on both
sides, effectively isolating it from the rest of Roshar.
The land was uninhabited by singers when humans
first arrived on Roshar, and though the human refugees
initially struggled to grow crops in Rosharan soil, they
found Shinovar more hospitable than most of the world.
Thousands of years later, Shin culture is still shaped by
their exodus from the planet that humanity destroyed.
```

```
Government
The Shin people are governed by the Stone Shamans.
That religious order is led by the Honorbearers who
govern Shinovar; the number of Honorbearers depends
on how many Honorblades the Shin possess (see
“Resources”). Regional officials known as “those who
add” include the Farmer, who guides the overall
well-being of each community, and the Cook, who
ensures none go hungry. Individual cities are led
by appointed ministers and elected mayors.
Unbeknownst to all but the
Honorbearers, all of Shinovar is ruled
by an entity called the Voice.
```

```
Military
The Shin religion accepts that “those
who subtract” are a necessary evil of any
society, and each monastery commands
a force of soldiers. The Farmer and
General in each community can
assign those soldiers as needed,
most frequently to defend
homesteads from foreign raiders.
Most soldiers are agile light
infantry fighters who train beside
Stone Shaman acolytes. They
learn swordplay along with the
martial art of kammar.

```
Social Ranking
Shin citizens divide themselves into “those who add”
and “those who subtract,” forming a social hierarchy
based on contributions to the welfare of others. These
roles are signaled by the splashes of color that people
with different occupations are allowed to wear.
The Farmer of each community is a highly respected
leader who is entitled to wear a brightly colored robe
with a long train that covers their horse while they ride.
Other people who contribute to society—such
as shepherds, musicians, and dancers—wear simpler
clothes but can adorn them with a single bright garment,
such as a sash or bandana. Meanwhile, merchants and
traders are expected to choose splashes that aren’t too
ostentatious. These customs vary by region and are
different in cities and rural areas.
At the bottom of the social ladder, warriors are
thought of as destroyers; rather than adding to society
like farmers do, warriors take away. Any Shin citizen
who picks up a weapon is forever condemned to the
life of a lowly warrior. They must wear a simple brown
uniform and relinquish their freedom to the will of the
Stone Shamans.
```

```
Shin Names
Shin names customarily string three parts together as
one. The first is the person’s given name; the second
reflects their gender by calling them either daughter,
son, or child; and the last is the name of one of their
parents (usually the one most similar to their gender
or with whom they share the closest relationship).
If a person feels they’ve disgraced their parents,
they may refer to themselves not as their parent’s child,
but as their grandparent’s child’s child. They do this
by repeating the middle part of the name twice and
changing the last part to the grandparent’s given name.
Examples of Shin names include Ali-daughter-
Hasweth, Gashash-son-Navammis, Masha-
daughter-Shaliv, Szeth-son-son-Vallano, and
Lanethen-child-Gemth.
```

```
Religion
Stone Shamanism is the only religion practiced in
Shinovar. This faith reveres natural spirits, especially
those of stone. To the Shin, stone holds sacred spren,
so it must not be disturbed, broken, or touched by
the general population. (See “Stone Shamanism” in
chapter 3.)
```

```
Agriculture
Unlike the rest of Roshar, Shinovar is covered in fertile
soil. Highstorms dwindle in intensity by the time they
cross the Misted Mountains to Shinovar. While most of
Roshar only experiences gentle, cremless rain during the
Weeping, Shinovar regularly receives mild storms that
further nourish its fields.
Crops that can’t survive elsewhere on Roshar flour-
ish here. These include offworld varieties the humans
brought with them when they first arrived, such as
strawberries, grapes, and wheat.
Foreigners aren’t allowed on farmland.
```

```
Resources
The Shin operate mines where soldiers and criminals
work. However, they often use Soulcast metal to make
tools and weapons, as it doesn’t require the butchery
of stone. The Elsecaller and Lightweaver monasteries
produce a small supply of Soulcast metal, but merchants
are eager to find other sources from abroad.
Crops and livestock are abundant in Shinovar.
Species of flora and fauna brought to the world by
the original humans are considered exotic delicacies
elsewhere in Roshar. Preserved fruit, chickens, horses,
and other unique exports make the long journey to
Shinovar worthwhile for ambitious merchants. Soulcast
metal is the best currency to use when trading in
Shinovar; the Shin consider the Stormlight in gems
to be holy, and thus gems are unsuitable for common
use as currency or light sources.
The Shin took possession of nine of the ten
Honorblades after the Last Desolation, using them to
train with the corresponding surges during the Era of
Solitude. Nale and Ishar have since reclaimed their
Blades, and Szeth took Jezrien’s Blade; meanwhile,
the Stone Shamans obtained Taln's Blade.
```

```
After the Everstorm
The Stone Shamans have long awaited the coming of
the Voidbringers and the True Desolation, training
generations to wield the power of the Honorblades.
However, they have continued to isolate themselves
thus far, standing apart from the conflict that embroils
the rest of Roshar.

Humans who originate from Thaylenah generally
have tanned skin, are shorter than average, and have
epicanthic folds on their eyes, but they are most
recognizable by their extremely long white eyebrows.
While some Thaylens tuck their eyebrows behind their
ears, others use wax or starch to form them into spikes,
bangs, ringlets, and other distinctive styles.
Thaylenah is also home to immigrants from other
Vorin nations. Those of mixed Thaylen heritage have
streaks of white in their eyebrows, but their eyebrows
don’t grow as long.
Thaylen architecture is flowery and decorative,
and their fashions similarly tend toward patterned
silk vests, shirts, and skirts with a nautical flair.
The Thaylen language can be distinguished by its
tendency to group consonants and its light inclusion
of vowels. People raised in Thaylenah speak with
a distinctive accent that often puts the accent on
unexpected consonants and groups words together.
Caste and Gender
As a Vorin nation, Thaylenah follows the caste divisions
based on eye color and the gender roles that Vorinism
is known for, but much less strictly than in Alethkar
or Jah Keved. Thaylens don’t use the Alethi system
of nahns and dahns nor do they have an extensive
noble caste; social mobility is driven more by success
in commerce.
Similarly, while women’s and men’s fashion and
food do differ, gender roles aren’t as strict as in Alethkar.
All genders are permitted to become merchants, and
men are allowed to read and write. Women generally
cover their safehands with gloves instead of a full sleeve,
and some Thaylens from younger generations reject
covering them altogether.
```

```
Religion
A local form of Vorinism is predominant among
Thaylens, though they reject its stricter aspects (see the
previous “Caste and Gender” section). Most Thaylens
also follow the Passions, a belief that wanting something
strongly enough will draw it to you. Many believe that
the most Passionate among the Thaylens will one day
be able to reopen the Oathgates and use them as portals
between worlds.
```

## Thaylenah

```
A trader stands with long white eyebrows tucked behind
his ear, haggling over a price. A captain hauls goods from
her ship to shore. Apprentices and guards trail behind a
master merchant in cap and vest, hurrying to an auction
as the city’s clocktower chimes. In Thaylenah, much of life
is about buying, selling, and traveling on the open sea.
Thaylenah is an island nation in southern Roshar
known for its traders and merchants. The nation
spans three main islands along with several nearby
islets. Thaylenah’s population is concentrated in the
largest of its islands, home to Thaylenah’s capital,
Thaylen City.
While Thaylenah is smaller than its northern
neighbors, the nation’s impact on Roshar is much
larger due to its focus on trade, the backbone of the
Thaylen economy.
```

```
Government
Thaylenah is an elective monarchy currently ruled by
Queen Fen Rnamdi, a shrewd strategist. Each monarch
is elected by an assembly of merchant councils and
high-ranking naval officers. The selected monarch has
authority over the decisions and direction of the nation,
but they’re generally thought of as the representative of
the merchant guilds, rather than as an absolute ruler.
The monarch’s successor is also selected by the assembly
on their death or abdication.
```

```
Military
Thaylenah has long focused on commerce instead
of conflict. However, this island nation does have a
long-standing naval tradition, and officers are trained
extensively in naval tactics and strategies. For years,
Thaylenah has commanded the largest fleet on Roshar.
Though lacking much of a land army, the nation has
a few highguards—members of long-standing houses
who wield Shards—sworn to defend the kingdom.
Collectively, they possess five Shardblades and three
suits of Shardplate.
```

```
Thaylen Culture
People from Thaylenah are well known across the world.
They have a reputation both for business and swindling,
but they aren’t considered to be particularly warlike
or aggressive. Curiosity is a defining attribute of the
Thaylen people, from the scientists of their artifabrian
guilds to the traders and explorers who sail the seas
of Roshar.
```

**70** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
Resources and Trade
The kingdom possesses five Shardblades and three suits
of Shardplate.
Thaylenah trades a variety of goods throughout
Roshar by land and sea. These exports include
cutting-edge fabrials. Thaylenah also participates
in the slave trade.
Thaylen merchants are ranked with levels ranging
from apprentices to master merchants. A merchant’s
cap and vest signify their rank, distinguishing them
from any servants, guards, or apprentices around
them. Those who wish to become a Thaylen mer-
chant must apprentice with a master merchant who
takes legal responsibility for them by becoming their
babsk—their legal parent. The apprentice helps their
babsk and learns from them until the master merchant
declares the apprentice is ready to strike out on
their own.
```

```
Most merchants own their own ships, but they
can also rent barges to transport goods. Ship captains
can be identified by the captain’s cord, a twenty-foot-
long white rope that each captain wraps in their colors
and then strings on their ship’s rigging as a mark
of ownership.
In addition to the customary system of trade,
Thaylenah has its own banking system. The gems in
the Thaylen Gemstone Reserve serve as a representation
of the money that individual merchants hold, allowing
merchants to conduct deals without the threat of theft.
Most of these gems are never removed from the reserve,
though many were scattered across the city during the
Battle of Thaylen Field (see “After the Everstorm”).

## Singers and Listeners

```
The singers are the indigenous people of Roshar.
They call themselves this because of their method of
communication: They sense the ever-present rhythms
of the cosmere, especially those on Roshar, and attune
to particular rhythms to express themselves as they
speak. The rhythms add context to their words, allowing
two singers who can hear a rhythm to abbreviate their
statements or add nuance.
Physically, singers are humanoids with marbled skin
in shades of red, black, and white (most commonly
in swirls of red-black or red-white). Their hairstrands
are usually orange or red, and their eyes are shades of
black and gray. Each singer typically grows carapace
over part of their body, though the location and amount
depend on the form they’ve taken (see the upcoming
“Singer Forms” section). This carapace can range from
decorative subdermal plates to chitinous armor. Singer
teeth are stronger than human teeth, with molars and
a digestive system that can process the shells of many
Rosharan fauna. Each singer also possesses a gemheart,
which is clouded white and fused to their sternum; this
allows the singer to bond with spren and change their
form in highstorms.
```

```
After the Everstorm
Thaylen City suffered catastrophic damage during the
first Everstorm. As the storm circles Roshar, the city
struggles to rebuild. The once prosperous economy of
Thaylenah is likewise collapsing.
A month and a half after the first Everstorm,
Odium attacked Thaylen City with a combined army
of warform singers and human soldiers. The Battle of
Thaylen Field was the first major battle—and victory—
of Dalinar’s coalition in the war, and Thaylen City
continues to be a bastion for Dalinar’s allies.
```

```
Thaylen Singers
Enslaved singers in Thaylenah endured lives of
uncertainty, never knowing when they might be plucked
from their homes and sold to masters in a different land.
Many worked in shipyards, assigned the grueling task of
shaping Thaylen lumber into seaworthy vessels.
When Thaylenah’s enslaved singers awakened, they
could fully process the suffering the humans inflicted
on them. Together, the singers commandeered most
of the ships that survived the Everstorm—the very
ships once used to deliver generations of their people
as merchandise.

Age of the Dawnsingers
The Dawnsingers, the ancient ancestors of modern
singers, thrived on Roshar long before humans arrived
on the planet. Using their language, the Dawnchant,
these singers recorded their history in a text called the
Eila Stele. They also taught early humans to speak the
Dawnchant, influencing the development of human
languages on Roshar. Although the Dawnchant
language was lost to the people of Roshar for ages and
they had no way to translate the Eila Stele, the words
contain major revelations about historical events that
have long been mistaken. For example, it names humans
as the Voidbringers—people who destroyed their own
planet and entreated the Dawnsingers for refuge, only to
bring destruction to Roshar.
The singers have undergone several cataclysmic
changes throughout history. These include a war with
the humans they accepted to their planet, followed
by the human invasion of singer lands; the singers’
subsequent turn to the power of Odium to fight back
against the invasion, creating immortal warriors known
as the Fused; the cyclical wars known as Desolations;
```

```
and the severing of most singers’ Connection and
Identity when Ba-Ado-Mishram was imprisoned (see
“False Desolation” in chapter 4). This final severing was
devastating for the singers, leaving them in an almost
catatonic state (see the upcoming “Slaveform” section).
Called parshmen by the humans, these singers were
subsequently exploited and enslaved by generations
of humans.
```

```
The Listeners
One known group of singers was unaffected by this theft
of the singers’ sense of self and self-determination: the
listeners. During the False Desolation, when Odium
and the Fused were imprisoned, Ba-Ado-Mishram
offered the singers a new type of power—Regal
forms—and forged a supernatural Connection between
all singers and herself. But unlike most other singers,
the listeners refused to accept this offer. Seeking peace
and independence rather than a return to war, a group
of listeners (later called the Last Legion) separated
from the other singers. This bold decision restricted
their access to forms, but it had one dramatic benefit:
```

nimbleform and
workform lisTeners
```

**74** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
JULIA MADDALINA
```

When the Radiants imprisoned Ba-Ado-Mishram,
all singers Connected to her were severed from their
spiritual Identity. Only the listeners survived with their
free will and autonomy intact.

Keepers of Songs
The listeners knew that once they rejected Connection
to Ba-Ado-Mishram, they would be restricted to
dullform and mateform. To ensure their descendants
wouldn’t forget, the listeners committed much of their
knowledge and history to song, with each song using
the beat of a different rhythm of Roshar. These songs
include those like the Song of Histories and Song of
Secrets, which document specific aspects of listener
history, along with others like the Song of Making Paper
and Song of Listing, which convey skills to pass on to
future generations. There are over a hundred songs,
and new ones continue being written. Each family of
listeners assigned a keeper of songs; this person devoted
themself to memorizing and passing this history to the
next generation.
The songs helped the listeners maintain their
culture even during the period they know as “the long
sleep,” when they knew only dullform and mateform
and primarily occupied lands in what was once
Natanatan and the Unclaimed Hills. Over time, led
by the Five—a council who made decisions by majority
vote—the listeners began working to discover more
forms, beginning with workform. As this happened,
the forms of the Five themselves changed, shifting from
an initial council of only dullform singers to one in
which there was one member of each known form.

```
The Listeners’ Fate
After many generations of the long sleep, modern
humans first encountered the listeners during
the reign of Gavilar, an Alethi monarch. While
early interactions seemed peaceful, King Gavilar’s
intentions were dangerous. Hoping a war between
humans and Fused would ignite the return of the
Knights Radiant, Gavilar sought the restoration of
these listener “gods” (see “Listener Gods: The Fused”
in chapter 3). A member of Gavilar’s retinue offered
a captive Voidspren to the listener scholar Venli,
promising a path to forms of power.
This led to a time of dramatic change for the
listeners, as Venli secretly bonded the Voidspren and
used its knowledge of the past to rediscover warform.
The listeners initially saw the Alethi as allies and sent
a diplomatic delegation to Kholinar. There, listeners
uncovered Gavilar’s plan to restore the Fused and
concluded he must be assassinated. These events
led directly to the Vengeance Pact and the War of
Reckoning (see “War of Reckoning” in chapter 4).
As war between listeners and Alethi escalated,
Venli finally persuaded the Five to accept a forbidden
form of power: stormform. Now susceptible to Odium’s
desires, the listeners used this Regal form to call the
Everstorm, which struck during the Battle of Narak.
In the wake of that chaotic battle, nearly all listeners
were slain or had their minds overtaken by Fused.
Only a small group of listeners survived that
battle, heading east to the floodplains to forge their
own community. Led by Thude of the First-Rhythm
Family, these listeners once again turned their backs
on war and sought their own community.
Remarkably, the first Everstorm also liberated the
singers’ Identity, Connection, and free will. Around
the world, parshmen awakened to the full extent of
what the humans had done to them. In the wake of this
change, most singers have once again turned to Odium
to stand against the humans who enslaved them for
generations. Accepting the Fused as their new leaders,
these singers are united in opposition to the forces of
humankind.
```

```
The listeners could no longer hide.
Conflict would find them. It was no
longer a choice between their gods or
freedom. It was a choice between their
gods and human slaving brands.
```

```
Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures 75
```

```
Singer Forms
Singers have bodies that morph to meet their needs
when certain conditions are met. The transitions
between forms hold spiritual significance for most who
experience them. Some forms are optimized for study
or crafting, while others fortify singers for war. Each
one is accessed by bonding a certain type of spren to
the singer’s gemheart during a storm. These forms
don’t change a person’s identity, but they can heavily
influence their disposition and inclinations, resulting in
personality changes. Certain forms grant extraordinary
abilities of the mind and body; for example, they can
physically alter the function and amount of carapace
on a body, enhance or decrease muscle mass, and
regulate hormones.
```

```
Recovered Forms
Though many singer forms have been lost to time, the
listeners documented them in their songs after walking
away from Odium (see the earlier “Keepers of Songs”
section). The Song of Listing lists at least ninety-one
different forms.
Before the Everstorm, only three lost forms had been
recovered, allowing singers to take those forms after
bonding the corresponding spren in a highstorm. Those
forms (plus dullform and mateform) operate as follows:
Dullform. In dullform, singers hear rhythms weakly
and have difficulty focusing. Simple tasks, such
as memorization, require a strong force of will.
Despite the name’s negative connotation, dullform
induces a protective state that optimizes survival,
conserving energy for the most basic functions of
the body. A singer can take dullform by bonding
spren unaffiliated with other forms, or by bonding
the incorrect type of spren for the form they intend
to take. Babies are born in a growth-promoting
version of dullform called childform; they remain in
childform until they grow old enough to bond a spren
in a highstorm, usually around the age of seven.
```

```
Mateform. In mateform, a singer’s body is optimized
for procreation. While most other forms are also
fertile, mateform directs a body’s energy to hormone
production and sexual function. A singer can take
mateform by bonding a lifespren and concentrating
on their desire to give and receive emotional intimacy.
Only a few singers who choose mateform remain in
it long term.
Nimbleform. In nimbleform, singers have greater
focus and can perform a variety of complex tasks,
especially those requiring dexterity. This form
has minimal cara pace, is physically weaker than
others, and has lower endurance. It directs the
body’s energy toward increased brain function and
fine motor skills. A singer can take nimbleform by
bonding a windspren.
Warform. In warform, a singer’s body increases in
height and bulk and gains armor-like carapace.
They are granted increased strength, endurance,
durability, and slightly accelerated healing; in
exchange, they require more food. Warform
encourages pragmatism and decreases the ability
to think abstractly. A singer can take warform by
bonding a painspren.
Workform. In workform, a singer’s body becomes
stronger and more resistant to cold weather, and
they grow carapace over the back of their hands.
This form is optimized for labor. Workform inclines
a singer toward obedience, task completion, and
finding peaceful solutions over violent ones. A singer
can take work form by bonding a gravitationspren.
```

```
Gender
Due to the singers’ ability to take on different forms,
their physical manifestation of gender is more flexible
than that of humans. Additionally, singer culture doesn’t
tend to impose gender binaries as much as many human
cultures do.
When procreating, a singer takes on the sex of male
or female, which grants them the physical ability to
reproduce. However, most singers lack the drive to
reproduce unless they adopt mateform. Outside of
reproduction, most singers instead present as malen or
femalen, two more neutral expressions of gender. If they
wish, singers can also manifest even more nuanced gender
identities in their physical appearance.
```

```
A form changes the way you think,
Venli. Everyone knew that. Eshonai had
lectured—incessantly, as had been her
way—about not letting the form dictate
one’s actions. Control the form, don’t let
it control you.
```

**76** Chapter 2: Nations and Cultures

```
Newly Rediscovered Forms
After Ba-Ado-Mishram’s imprisonment, singers across
Roshar existed in the state listeners called slaveform.
When the Everstorm freed them, those singers gained
access to their repressed identities and autonomy. Along
with that, they rediscovered many additional forms,
including artform, scholarform, and mediationform:
Artform. In artform, a singer’s body is adorned in
colorful, cosmetic carapace, their mind is inclined
toward personal and artistic expression, and they
become hyperaware of rhythms. A singer can take
artform by bonding a creationspren.
Scholarform. In scholarform, a singer’s mental
prowess and patience increase, and they can retain
large amounts of new information with ease. A singer
can take scholarform by bonding a logicspren.
Mediationform. In mediationform, a singer’s
eloquence and mental clarity increase, and they
can better comm unicate and resolve disputes.
A singer can take mediationform by bonding
a bindspren.
```

```
Regal Forms
Singers who bond with Voidspren are known as Regals.
This bond bestows powers that go beyond simple
changes in form and mindset.
Regals are more powerful than other singers and
humans. They have a difficult time hearing rhythms
in the same way most singers do, instead favoring
“rhythms of power.” While listener songs do record
the forms of power taken on by Regals, many have yet
to be fully rediscovered or understood. Some Regal
forms include the following:
Envoyform. Envoyform Regals are tall with long limbs,
and their carapace is primarily ornamental. In this
form, Regals can speak, read, and understand any
human or singer language after hearing only a few
sentences of it. Some envoyforms have a remarkable
ability to infer intention and emotion from non-
verbal cues.
Stormform. Stormform Regals are lithe with skin
covered in protective ridges, a carapace mask beneath
the skin of their face, and barbed carapace on the
backs of their hands. As the name suggests, stormform
Regals can channel red lightning as a weapon, using
it to electrocute foes at a distance and overwhelm them
with power at close range. (See “Regal” in chapter 8
for an example of stormform.)
Other Forms. Other known Regal forms include
direform (an elite soldier covered in heavy carapace)
and relayform (suited for scouting and passing
messages). Listener songs record other Regal
forms that weren’t well understood during the
Era of Solitude, including decayform, nightform,
and smokeform. (For more information on Regal
forms, see chapter 2 of the Stormlight Handbook .)

Slaveform

_“I have spent my entire_ life _living in a fog. Every day
knowing I should say something, do_ something _to stop
this! Every night clutching my daughter, wondering why
the world seems to move around us in the light—while
we are trapped in shadows.”_
—Sah, formerly enslaved
Singers awakened by the Everstorm have endured
unspeakably traumatic lives. Each enslaved singer
was like a prisoner in their own body: aware of their
environment and physical sensations, but deprived
of agency and self-determination. Though born with
minds and souls, they were cut off from the Identity
and Connection that form their spiritual selves.
Listeners who observed singers in this state called
it “slaveform,” reflecting the oppression that its victims
endured. Though it resembled dullform, it was actually
the lack of a form, preventing those singers from
binding spren. Singers without forms were compelled
to obey basic commands and perform grueling physical
labor. They felt the weight of enslavement and exploit-
ation, but they couldn’t defend themselves.

```
Humans called these singers “parshmen” and viewed
them as having little ambition or impetus to act beyond
following orders. However, singers in this form reacted
strongly to the disturbance of their dead. They remained
capable of limited speech and would sometimes hum
to one another—an echo of the rhythms they could
no longer access.
After the Everstorm awakened them, these singers
remembered their lives spent in slavery and the sense
of profound wrongness they suffered each day. Across
Roshar, singers share a determination to never again
let humans decide their fate.
```

```
After the Everstorm
With their sense of self and autonomy restored,
many formerly enslaved singers fled the lives they had
known to find new places and their own purposes.
Most awakened in workform, though some took
other forms.
Each singer had a lifetime of cultural exposure
to the nations they were enslaved in; acting on this
knowledge, many took on the activities and attitudes
```

```
of the humans they had lived among. Thaylen singers
took to the sea in ships, Alethi sought war with their
oppressors, and Azish attempted to negotiate with
their government. However, most singers (reluctantly
or otherwise) ended up pressed into the service of the
Fused, who needed soldiers to conquer Roshar.
Some singers have sought independence, recogniz-
ing that Odium only seeks to use their justified anger
for his own destructive ends. However, they face
hostility on all sides. Most humans are incredibly
dismissive of the abuse singers suffered at their hands,
refusing to take accountability and instead treating the
newly awakened singers as threats to be dealt with.
After generations of having their identities and
self hood suppressed, it’s unclear what’ll become of
the singers in this new era, as they grapple with their
treatment at the hands of humans and the ramifications
of the True Desolation’s world war.
```

```
Rhythms of Roshar
All singers can hear the rhythms of Roshar—ever-
present melodies that suffuse the entire planet. There
are many different rhythms, each associated with a
different emotion.
A singer can attune to different rhythms
corresponding to their mood; the melody affects how
they speak, conveying their emotional state through
the cadence of their words. By concentrating enough,
a singer can even speak to a rhythm that doesn’t
genuinely represent their feelings. This can be done
out of self-correction or in an effort to veil the truth.
Singers who take on Regal forms of power gain
access to a new set of rhythms that have been changed
by their connection to the god Odium. Each of these
corresponds to one of the standard rhythms but alters
it slightly, as shown in the Rhythms of Roshar table.
```

```

“You may speak now,” Venli said to

to that of Confidence—one of the old
rhythms. The true rhythms, uncorrupted

SVETLANA KOSTINA

## WORLD GUIDE VERSION WORLD GUIDE VERSION

**chapter 3**

## Cosmology and Religion

```
Those who shattered the power of creation had
varying motivations. Some craved its power them-
selves, while others believed Adonalsium’s death was
necessary. Regardless of their motives, the Shattering
had an im measurable effect on the cosmere. Very little
is known about the cosmere pre-Shattering, but the
event affected magic and society throughout the many
planets of the cosmere.
```

```
Shards of Adonalsium
The Shards are sixteen pieces of the power of creation.
They exist in all three realms, but their power is con-
centrated in the Cognitive Realm and Spiritual Realm.
Each Shard has a specific motivation, reflected in its
name: Ambition, Autonomy, Cultivation, Devotion,
Dominion, Endowment, Honor, Invention, Mercy,
Odium, Preservation, Reason, Ruin, Valor, Virtuosity,
and Whimsy. (For details on Cultivation, Honor,
and Odium, see “Roshar’s Three Shards” later in
t h is chapter.)
The Shards are the most powerful known entities
in the cosmere, functioning as the gods of the cosmere.
Each began with power equal to the others, but conflict
has weakened many, while others have Invested their
power in other beings and worlds.
When the Shards Invest a world, this infuses the
world with Investiture and defines the natural laws
of the world, which are tied back to the Shard. The
Shards can also move planets and alter living beings.
Despite their immense power, Shards are limited.
They’re predisposed to act in accordance with their
divine Intent, and acting in the opposite manner is
often nearly impossible. The Shards can’t break any
deals, oaths, or rules without leaving weaknesses in
themselves that can be exploited by other Shards.
Furthermore, a Shard must be wielded by a sapient
creature who has Ascended to become a Vessel.
```

```
Dead Shards
Odium killed the Shards of Ambition, Devotion,
Dominion, and Honor. Since then, the remnants of
Devotion and Dominion exist in the Cognitive Realm
as a combined power known as the Dor. Meanwhile,
Ruin and Preservation have partially united in the
same Vessel, creating Harmony.

```
oshar’s many religions all reflect the
fundamental truths of the cosmere, though
each religion has grown lopsided or twisted over
thousands of years of erosion and factional agendas.
Faith is more fragile than ever as revelations of ancient
truths unfold, but one thing is certain: Uncovering
Roshar’s lost history, putting aside differences, and
uniting against hatred incarnate is the only way to
break the cycle of calamitous mistakes born of distrust,
desperation, and despair.
This chapter discusses the great forces of Roshar,
the Rosharan system and other systems of the cosmos,
and the world’s predominant religions.
```

## Adonalsium

```
The exact nature of Adonalsium is shrouded in mystery.
Whether a cosmic force of nature or an intelligent—
perhaps even deific—being, Adonalsium is the power
of creation itself.
Seemingly driven to create life, Adonalsium used four
Commands—the Dawnshards—to create the cosmere,
its realms, and its powers. Many facets of the cosmere
still reflect Adonalsium’s designs, including the entire
Rosharan system. Other aspects of it can be glimpsed
through its Shards and their names.
```

```
Shattering of Adonalsium
The defining moment in the history of the cosmere
was the Shattering of Adonalsium—the moment when
a group of conspirators used the Dawnshards against
Adonalsium, sundering and killing this most powerful
entity in the cosmere. In that moment, the power of
creation fractured into sixteen Shards, each bearing
an aspect of Adonalsium’s nature. The conspirators
then seized that power, each choosing Shards they felt
a connection to or that they felt they could control.
In so doing, they changed the cosmere forever.

Splinters
A Splinter is a fragment of a Shard’s power. When a
Shard is killed, its power can be Splintered, but a Shard
can also split off Splinters of its own choice. Either way,
Splinters act independently and with free will. The
Radiant spren on Roshar are Splinters of Honor and
Cultivation.
```

```
Vessels and Slivers
Shards require Vessels—sapient creatures from the
Physical Realm who become intertwined with the
Shards through an act called Ascension. The Shards of
Adonalsium table lists the sixteen Shards, their original
Vessels, and and worlds closely tied to each Shard.

```
Ascension
When a Vessel claims a Shard, they undergo Ascension,
their body is subsumed, and their mind expands. The
Vessel interprets the Shard’s power and has some effect
on how it’ll manifest, but the Shard is ultimately bound
by its Intent. For example, though Rayse saw himself as
a Shard of Passion, his actions were still guided by the
nature of Odium’s divine hatred.
The Shard’s power sustains the Vessel and drives
the relationship. Over time, the Vessel’s mind changes
to align with the Shard’s Intent. Fighting against that
Intent weakens both the Vessel and the Shard.
Slivers
A Sliver is a person who once held a Shard’s power,
leaving their soul forever altered.
```

## Rosharan System

```
Also known as Greater Roshar, the Rosharan system is
a planetary system created by Adonalsium. It contains
Roshar, twelve other planets, and three moons. Of the
system’s thirteen planets, ten are gas giants separated
from the terrestrial planets by an asteroid belt.
```

```
Terrestrial Planets
The Rosharan system has three terrestrial planets,
listed in order of proximity to the sun:
Ashyn. Ashyn is volcanically active and mostly barren,
but it hosts a small human population in floating cities.
Long ago, after a great cataclysm caused by overusing
surges, most of the planet’s populace fled to Roshar.
Roshar. The planet Roshar is orbited by three moons.
This world contains one supercontinent of the same
name, which is home to most of the sapient lifeforms
in the planetary system. The Shards of Honor and
Cultivation shaped the history of this planet.
Braize. The planet Braize contains a core of metal
that draws in Investiture. The souls of the Fused are
bound here, though they migrate to Roshar during
Desolations. Braize is a cold, empty, and completely
inhospitable world ravaged by winds.
The inhabitants of the Rosharan system include
humans, singers, Siah Aimians, the Sleepless, and
a wide variety of sapient spren.
```

```
Gas Giants
The Rosharan system’s gas giants are named for Vorin
numerals. In order of proximity to the sun, they are Jes,
Nan, Chach, Vev, Palah, Shash, Betab, Kak, Tanat,
and Ishi. These planets are uninhabited, and none are
known to possess moons or ring systems.
```

```
The Planet Roshar
Here in this world, I found perfection, a relic of the being
I had slain for its own good. Roshar had been grown
entirely from equations, as a grand testament to the divine
nature of mathematics—a celebration of the intimate
relationship between song, numbers, and art.
—Tanavast
Long before the Shattering, Adonalsium created the
Rosharan system. The planet Roshar was a world
of fractal growth and infinite potential, one attuned
to the rhythms of creation.
Roshar is smaller than most of the cosmere’s human-
inhabited planets, with a lower gravi tational acceleration
(70% of cosmere standard). As a result, Roshar’s
human inhab itants tend to be taller than those
```

**82** Chapter 3: Cosmology and Religion

```
of other worlds. The percentage of oxygen in the
planet’s atmosphere is also higher than most worlds.
Roshar is also the name of the planet’s vast super-
continent. This landmass lies primarily in the southern
hemisphere, so northern areas like the Reshi Isles have
a hot equatorial climate, while southern nations like
Thaylenah have colder weather.
When Cultivation and Honor arrived on Roshar, they
found it populated by fragments of creation called spren.
In particular, three primal spren echoed Adonalsium’s
influence: the wind, the night, and the stone.
Day and Night
The humans of Roshar divide the planet’s day into
twenty hours. Dawn arrives at the fifth hour, and dusk
sets in at the fifteenth hour, giving the planet ten hours
of daylight and ten of night.
```

```
Moons
Roshar’s three moons orbit the planet once a day.
Because of their predictable rise and fall, humans
mark time at night by marking each moon’s moonrise,
moonheight, and moonset over the course of ten
hours, as shown on the Rosharan Moonrises table.
Aside from the darkness of the seventeenth hour—
sometimes known as the hateful hour—one moon
is always visible in the night sky.
The moons’ colors echo the Shards of Odium,
Honor, and Cultivation:
Salas, the dimmest moon, always rises first. It’s violet,
a color associated with Odium.
Nomon, the largest moon, always rises second. It’s pale
blue, a color associated with Honor.
Mishim, the smallest moon, always rises last. It’s green,
a color associated with Cultivation.
```

```
Roshar and the Cosmere
Roshar connects in time and space to the rest of the
cosmere; these connections exist not only within the
Physical Realm, but in the Cognitive Realm as well.
In the Physical Realm, distances between different
worlds are vast. Other inhabited systems, which are
unknown to most Rosharans, can be seen only as
constellations in the night sky.
In the Cognitive Realm, the space between inhabited
systems is vastly compressed. Thus, the Rosharan
subastral lies relatively near the Expanse of Vapors
(which leads to Scadrial), the Expanse of Densities
(which leads to Sel), the Expanse of Vibrance (which
leads to Nalthis), and the Expanse of the Broken Sky
(which leads to Taldain).
For more information about the Cognitive Realm,
commonly known as Shadesmar, see chapter 7.

## Other Worlds

```
Beyond the Rosharan system, the cosmere is home
to many planets, including Bjendal, Canticle, Dhatri,
First of the Sun, Komashi, Lumar, Mythos, Nalthis,
Obrodai, Scadrial, Sel, Taldain, Threnody, UTol, Vax,
and Yolen. Many of these host Shards of Adonalsium
who influence the Investiture, history, and culture of
that planet.
The following sections briefly introduce some of
the most important planets, as well as the Shards that
inhabit them, their power, and their relationship to
the cosmere.
```

```
First of the Sun
First of the Sun is a world in the Drominad system.
The people who inhabit its mainland trade with
island-dwelling hunters and trappers who are willing
to brave the deadly archipelago called the Pantheon.
Many Shards have intervened in First of the Sun’s
history, but Autonomy’s avatar Patji is the most
notable instance.
The magic on First of the Sun is noticeable
throughout nature. Many animals can detect other
creatures’ thoughts, and some plants can emanate
the thoughts of creatures. Birds known as Aviars are
used by trappers to block thought waves and protect
themselves from predators. Worldhoppers have brought
some of these remarkable birds to Roshar.
```

```
Roshar and Worldhoppers
Roshar has an intriguing relationship with the cosmere’s
other worlds. Many individuals and organizations across
the cosmere are interested in Roshar, as its Investiture
takes the form of Stormlight, a highly renewable resource.
In addition, Surgebinding is considered one of the most
powerful Invested Arts in the cosmere—enough so that
Rayse, Odium’s original Vessel, believed that other Shards
would go to war for it if they discovered it.
Due to the close connections between planets in the
Cognitive Realm, it’s possible to travel between worlds.
Those who travel (and often trade) between worlds are
known as worldhoppers. The letter from Khriss in this
book’s introduction was written by one such worldhopper.
Cultivation’s Perpendicularity (atop the Horneater
Peaks) makes Roshar comparatively easy to access from
elsewhere in the Cognitive Realm; some other worlds
aren’t as readily accessible.
```

```
Nalthis
Nalthis is a world in the Nalthian system. Its kingdoms
include Idris and Hallandren, the latter of which
is a jungle rich with plant life that produces dyes.
Endowment, the Shard hosted here, causes humans
to be born with one Breath. Through Breath, they
can animate objects by combining color and an
Awakening Command.
The Awakened technology of the Nalthians has
spread throughout the cosmere, and they’re researching
the use of perpendicularities for trading.
At least two notable Nalthians have traveled to
Roshar: Vasher (going by Zahel) sought an ethical
source for the Investiture he needs to survive, and
Vivenna (going by Azure) sought Zahel. Vasher helped
Awaken the sentient sword Nightblood, which was
inspired by Roshar’s Shardblades.
```

```
Scadrial
Scadrial is a world in the Scadrian system. It hosts the
Shards Ruin and Preservation, which are currently
entwined, creating Harmony.
On Scadrial, metal can be used to store or access
Investiture in three ways: Allomancy is the act of
ingesting and “burning” metal to activate different
Allomantic powers. Feruchemy allows its wielders to
store certain attributes in metal then extract them later.
Hemalurgists, meanwhile, can transfer Investiture and
abilities between people.
The Ghostbloods originate from Scadrial and seek
to protect it, sending agents to Roshar and other worlds
across the cosmere.
```

```
Sel
Sel is a large world in the Selish system. The Shards
Devotion and Dominion settled there, which gave
Odium an excuse to attack and Splinter them (as Shards
interfering with one another was against the Vessels’
rules). Their remnants became the Dor, which powers
Investiture on Sel.
Sel has many region-specific methods of wielding
Investiture across its continents and empires, including
AonDor, Bloodsealing, ChayShan, Dakhor, and
Forgery. Each uses symbols or shapes as “code” to
create magical effects. People also form bonds (similar
to Nahel bonds) with seons and skaze, which are
Splinters of Devotion and Dominion.
```

```

Taldain

Taldain is a world in the Taldain system. It’s the current
residence of the Shard Autonomy, who keeps the world
isolated from the rest of the cosmere.
Taldain is tidally locked—one side (Darkside)
experiences eternal night, while the other (Dayside)
swelters in eternal daylight. Darkside’s magic functions
through tattoo-like starmarks. Dayside contains more
Investiture, and its magic manifests as sand mastery,
allowing the manipulation of white sand.
White sand’s ability to measure and detect Investiture
makes it valuable to worldhoppers studying the cosmere.
Ghostbloods, artifabrians, and Fused have all made use
of white sand imported to Roshar.

Threnody

Threnody is a world in the Threnodite system. Here,
Odium dealt Ambition a grievous blow, and though
Ambition ultimately perished elsewhere, the trauma
of that battle had a profound effect on Threnody.

```
Humans huddle in fortress towns and precarious
homesteads, surrounded by the haunted Forests of
Hell. But even those areas are safe compared to the
Fallen World, an entire continent controlled by an
entity called the Evil.
Threnody has no Investiture usable by humans.
Instead, the shades that haunt the Forests of Hell are
the manifestation of Investiture, and the only way to
combat them is with silver.
```

```
Yolen
Yolen, a world in the Yolish system, is one of the oldest
inhabited planets in the cosmere and former home
of Adonalsium. Adonalsium’s murderers were Yolish
people; after the Shattering, they became the Shards
and left Yolen to travel to other planets. Nowadays,
Yolen’s remaining population of humans, dragons,
and Sho Del is very small.
```

**worlds beyond roshar**

## Roshar’s Three Shards

```
The world of Roshar is influenced by three Shards of
Adonalsium: Honor, Cultivation, and Odium.
After the Shattering, the Vessels of Honor and
Cultivation—who were lovers—traveled to the Rosharan
system. This was a violation of the contract between the
sixteen Shards, who had agreed to keep some distance
from one another. It was the first of many times when
Honor’s power and his Vessel found themselves at odds.
The story of the Rosharan system is one of conflict
between the Shards, especially Honor and Odium.
After their conflict all but destroyed Ashyn, the
surviving humans fled to Roshar. Since then, Odium
has continued to promote hatred, slavery, and ceaseless
conflict between the people of Roshar.
```

```
Honor
Honor is the Shard of oaths, law, order, and binding.
At the Shattering of Adonalsium, the Shard of Honor
was claimed by Tanavast, who became Honor’s Vessel.
```

```
Vessel
The human Tanavast was the original Vessel of Honor.
As a man, he was a simple tanner and leatherworker.
His mortal features are amplified in his deific appear-
ance: Tanavast appeared to humans as a stately man
with rich umber skin, white hair that fell past his
shoulders, and a tall, muscular build. A golden cropped
coat and billowing trousers added to his grandeur.
During his life, Tanavast was the lover and partner
of Koravellium, a dragon who became the Vessel of
Cultivation. Tanavast was a kind and compassionate
man, but those qualities weren’t always aligned with
Honor’s nature as a Shard. Over time, Tanavast became
obsessed with oaths, sometimes placing more importance
on a vow than the meaning behind it. Tanavast the man
sought to save his people from war, but as Honor, he was
driven to oppose Odium no matter the cost.
Power and Works
The Investiture of Honor manifests as Stormlight and is
blue-white in color. The combined Investiture of Honor
and Cultivation influenced the existing spren of Roshar,
encouraged the creation of new spren, and shaped
sapient spren.
After Odium created the Fused, Honor created the
Heralds. He bound himself to ten humans, granting
them a measure of his powers. (See “Heralds” and
“Listener Gods: The Fused” later in this chapter.)
Together, Honor and the Heralds created the
Oathpact, which the Heralds later abandoned (after
multiple Desolations and unquantifiable suffering).
Tanavast continued to struggle between his human
emotions and his Shard’s nature. After Tanavast
betrayed Ba-Ado-Mishram—an action with devastating
effects for singers across Roshar—the power of Honor
rejected him, Tanavast died, and Honor retreated from
the world of mortals.
```

```
The Stormfather
Highstorms are the domain of the Stormfather.
He describes himself as one of the most powerful
spren on Roshar and father of all honorspren. A piece
of Tanavast—including his memories—is represented
in the Stormfather.
```

Tanavast,

Vessel of Honor. DONATO GIANCOLA

```
A shadow of Honor’s former self, the Stormfather
regards the quarrels of humans with aloof disdain.
The Stormfather’s driving purposes are to generate
the highstorms that provide Roshar with Stormlight,
to facilitate bonds and oaths, and to seek a more worthy
Vessel for Honor. Through the Stormfather, Tanavast
sends memories to humans in the form of visions
that promise to prepare the humans for the coming
Desolation.
From the sky, the Stormfather can surveil anywhere
his highstorms are present. Humans usually can’t
perceive him, but sometimes he speaks to them in a
booming voice during a highstorm, or he appears as
storm clouds that form an imperious face stretching
as far as the eye can see.
Like other sapient spren, the Stormfather is capable
of bonding with a mortal. He came to Gavilar Kholin
before his death, then later chose Dalinar as a new
Bondsmith. The Stormfather often communicates in
a sanctimonious or callous manner—but despite being
irked by human entitlement, he’s generally cooperative
and wishes to see Honor’s work come to fruition.
Religious Interpretation
Listeners regard Honor with a mix of wonder, fear, and
resentment. They see him as a traitor for choosing the
humans over them, but they don’t wish to offend him
or draw the wrath of the Stormfather.
Vorinism worships Honor as the Almighty and
reveres his Heralds as auxiliary deities. Though the
details of this faith vary between nations, Vorin faithful
generally believe the Stormfather is either the Almighty
or one of the Heralds.
```

```
Cultivation
Cultivation is growth incarnate, a flowing current of life
and Investiture whose Intent is to grow, prune, shape,
and transform. At the Shattering of Adonalsium, the
Shard of Cultivation was claimed by Koravellium Avast,
who became Cultivation’s Vessel.
```

```
Vessel
Koravellium Avast, known to ancient Rosharans as
Koravari, is the Vessel of Cultivation. She’s a dragon who
often manifests in a human form when interacting with
mortals. In her human form, she has very dark, cool-
toned brown skin and thick, springy curls. A sweeping
moss-brown dress accentuates her muscular frame and
broad hips, draping to the floor.
Koravellium Avast is known for weaving intricate
long-term plans, always remaining a step ahead of her
adversaries. She loved Tanavast, a human who became
the Vessel of Honor, until he betrayed Ba-Ado-Mishram.
```

Koravellium Avast,

Vessel of Cultivation.

```
“Why do we need Radiants? Because
they represent our best selves. We are of
Honor and Cultivation. Honor, for an
ideal. Cultivation, for the power to reach
toward that ideal.”
```

```
Chapter 3: Cosmology and Religion 87
```

IRINA NORDSOL

```
Power and Works
Cultivation’s Investiture manifests as Lifelight and is
faintly green in color. She’s skilled with future sight and
can intervene in human affairs using a power referred
to as the Old Magic. The combined Investiture of
Cultivation and Honor influenced and nurtured spren.
In an effort to protect the humans, Cultivation and
Honor opposed Odium together. After Honor’s betrayal
and death, Cultivation withdrew to grieve. Many
thought she’d given up on the people of Roshar, but her
isolation was strategic so she could regroup and plan.
Cultivation typically waits for people to call on her
before meddling in their lives. This is especially true of
her use of the Old Magic. Through the Nightwatcher,
she has carefully pruned important figures, hoping
each will use her gifts to find their purpose and further
the betterment of Roshar. Cultivation’s plots unfold
over the course of millennia, and more than once, she
has taken actions that seemed to empower Odium
or his servants. It remains to be seen whether these
are all part of a larger plan, or if her allegiance isn’t
what it seems.
```

```
The Nightwatcher
The Nightwatcher, a powerful Splinter of Cultivation,
resides in the eerily lush Valley of the mountains of
Ur. This enigmatic spren appears as a vaguely human
woman made of green mist. She has a delicate face with
silken black eyes, and she uses long, claw-like arms to
pull herself forward. However, she doesn’t resemble
humans as closely in appearance or mindset as do most
sapient spren. Instead, she’s closer to her original form
as the primal spren of night.
Through Cultivation’s power, the Nightwatcher can
bestow a boon and a curse to those who seek her out.
People travel from near and far to visit her—usually
in secret, as her Old Magic is met with skepticism and
disapproval in many cultures. In most cases, she’s
willing to grant a person their desire, but not always
in the way they expect. The obligatory curse paired
with the boon is often unrelated and strange in nature.
Due to this unpredictability, the Nightwatcher’s
visitors tend to be desperate by the time they beseech
her for help.
Cultivation can intervene in the Nightwatcher’s
dealings, but only does so in rare instances when
she feels further growth is possible with additional
pruning. Unlike Honor’s method of aiding humans,
Cultivation doesn’t bind them to her will. Her esoteric
gifts are imparted with hope their receivers will choose
to change.
```

```
Religious Interpretation
Before the arrival of humans, some singers worshipped
Cultivation and Honor as their gods.
In parts of western Roshar, Cultivation is venerated
as the embodiment of nature and the Mother of the
World. In the east, especially in Vorin countries, belief
in her and the Nightwatcher is considered unhallowed
and rooted in superstition. Her association with Old
Magic and future sight likely feed into their dismissal
of her existence and merit.
```

```
Odium
Odium is a scourge who intends to eliminate the other
Shards of Adonalsium so he can become the only god
of the cosmere. He rejects the idea that his purpose
is driven by hatred, insisting he is passion in its most
authentic and undiluted form. At the Shattering of
Adonalsium, the Shard of Odium was claimed by the
human Rayse, who became Odium’s Vessel.
```

```
Arrival on Roshar
Before invading Roshar, Odium had already proven
himself a force of destruction. In addition to Splintering
three Shards, he was instrumental to the downfall of
the world of Ashyn. When he manipulated humans into
experimenting with surges, Honor escalated hostilities.
The resulting cataclysm drove humans to the closest
habitable planet: Roshar.
These human refugees arrived in the land later
known as Shinovar. This turned Odium’s attention to
Roshar, where he saw the opportunity to incite a new
war. Odium’s influence amplified the singers’ distrust
of the offworlders, while fueling the humans’ appetite
for expansion. When singers pushed back against these
incursions, Odium twisted their justified anger into
desperate vengeance. Stoking hatred among singers and
humans alike, he sparked a war that lasted millennia.
Vessel
The human Rayse was the original Vessel of Odium.
When visiting singers, he assumed the appearance of
an ancient singer with gold and white marbled skin,
carrying a golden scepter.
To humans, he appeared as an elderly Shin man with
light beige skin, white hair peppered with a few black
strands, a full mustache, and a neatly trimmed beard.
Rayse wore a golden crown, perhaps to establish his
superiority over his peers, and carried the same scepter
as in his singer guise.
Rayse was already cunning and arrogant before
becoming a Vessel. As Odium’s Vessel, enmity and
bitterness radiated from his personage in every guise.
```

**88** Chapter 3: Cosmology and Religion

```
Power and Works
Odium’s Investiture manifests as Voidlight, a violet-
black aura that seems to draw in light. His displays
of power also include black shadows and red or
golden light.
Odium created the Fused to rouse the singers and
bend them to his will (see “Listener Gods: The Fused”
later in this chapter). The humans proved no match for
these ancient, immortal singers, prompting Honor to
bind ten humans as Heralds with enough power to hold
their ground against the Fused.
Cultivation and Honor forced Odium to leave the
rest of the cosmere alone and stay within Greater
Roshar, where his malicious influence would grow to
affect the entire system. Eventually Rayse triumphed
over Tanavast and Honor was left without a Vessel, but
Odium remained bound by the contract Tanavast forged
with Honor’s power: He can only claim Roshar through
a contest of champions, a duel decided with the death
of one proxy.
Odium can grant surges—sometimes called
Voidbinding—and the form of immortality he offers
the Fused. He has used some of his power to create
the Voidspren (glowing spren who don’t need a bond
for sapience) and the Unmade (more powerful spren
who are Splinters of Odium). His Unmade foster fear,
bloodlust, and unrest throughout Roshar.
Odium sees Cultivation’s purpose as conflicting with
his, likely due to his need to manipulate and stunt his
followers, thus hindering their ability to grow. To turn
humans against Cultivation, Odium claims she’s only
interested in change and doesn’t care if those changes
are disastrous.
Odium continues to strive toward a final Desolation.
He utilizes thunderclasts, the Unmade, Fused, Regals,
and other Voidbringers to assist him (see “Odium’s
Forces” in chapter 5).
```

```
Religious Interpretation
The historical records about Voidbringers are a subject
of religious concern in both singer and human cultures.
Ironically, humans believe singers are these ancient
Voidbringers, while singers instead believe humans
are the Voidbringers.

## Heralds

```
Perhaps the most revered figures on Roshar are the
Heralds, servants of the Almighty who held back the
Voidspren and Fused from devastating Roshar. The
Heralds are central figures in Vorinism, Roshar’s largest
religion. The Azish know them as the Kadasixes, and
across Roshar, people of many other faiths worship
the Heralds as well. They are seen by most as divine
protectors of humankind—but while this may once have
been true, the truth these days is far more tragic. Over
the eons since the Last Desolation, their mental states
have deteriorated, battered by millennia of conflict and
torture. They have found their personalities twisted
into extreme, obsessive versions of their mortal selves.
This section explores the Heralds as revered
figures, powerful beings, and individuals who are now
influencing Roshar in new ways. See chapter 4 for
more information about the Heralds’ role in Roshar’s
history, particularly regarding the Oathpact, the Knights
Radiant, and the Last Desolation.
```

```
The Ten Heralds
There are ten Heralds, each associated with one of
the ten orders of the Knights Radiant and one of the
Ten Essences (see “Soulcaster Savant” in chapter 8).
The Heralds table provides each Herald’s name,
Radiant order, Essence, and attributes, listed in order
of the Vorin number they’re associated with.

```
Jezrien
The Herald of Kings and Windrunners, Jezrien has
become mythologized across Roshar as one of the
greatest humans who ever lived. Eight thousand years
ago, he was a king who served Odium on the planet
Ashyn. When he arrived as a refugee on Roshar, he did
so alongside his own subjects and those of city-states
they had fought. These people, including the other
future Heralds, sought a new life of peace on Roshar.
However, Odium followed the humans to Roshar
and found a new conflict to incite. The resulting
Desolations led Jezrien and other former Surgebinders
to beg Honor for power, which he granted under the
strict terms of the Oathpact. Jezrien fought alongside
the other Heralds before they ultimately turned their
backs on the Oathpact.
Unfortunately, Jezrien’s mind slowly crumbled under
the weight of millennia, and he lost himself to despair.
At the beginning of the True Desolation, Jezrien was
permanently slain by an assailant with a raysium knife.
Vorins swear by Jezrien, burn glyphwards in prayer
to him, and know him as king of the Heralds. The Vorin
kingdoms often conflate him with the Stormfather,
and they even hang accused criminals outside during
highstorms to be judged by Jezrien. However, in the
current era, knowledge is spreading that Jezrien and
the Stormfather aren’t the same entity.
In the kingdom of Emul, Jezrien is their only god,
worshipped under the name Prime Kadasix. Emuli
believe he named their kingdom and its capital, Sese-
malex Dar. In Makabaki kingdoms, Jezrien is known as
Yaezir, Kadasix of Kings. They believe he chooses each
new Prime Aqasix—their elected ruler—and will guide
them to the person he has ordained as the next Prime.
```

```
Nale
Nale is known by a hundred different names and
several titles, including the Illuminator and the Herald
of Justice. He’s the only living Skybreaker of the
Fifth Ideal. Like Honor, whom he has served since
the war on Ashyn, Nale has grown obsessed with
the law and has abandoned compassion. At Ishar’s
direction, Nale hunted down Surgebinders and killed
them in hopes of preventing the Desolation. When he
couldn’t stop it, he took his Skybreakers and joined
the singers, and he has since been fighting for them
in Emul. He doesn’t fight because he supports Odium,
but because he acknowledges the singers’ grievances
as legitimate and just.
```

**90** Chapter 3: Cosmology and Religion

```
In Vorinism, Nale is known as Nalan, and people
of the Vorin kingdoms often swear by Nalan’s hand in
matters of justice. Many figures of speech also invoke
him; while some say “Nalan send ...” to express hope,
“Nale’s nuts” is another (much cruder) phrase.
In Shinovar, he’s known as Nin-son-God, a founder
of humankind.
In Azir, he’s known as Nakku the Judge.
Chanaranach
Brave and devoted, Chanaranach is the patron Herald
of the Dustbringers. On Ashyn, she was Jezrien’s
bodyguard, known for bravery, self-control, and
skill in combat. During the Desolations, she was
exceptional at navigating battlefields with speed and
precision, waiting to strike until she was sure her
attack would only harm her intended target.
Phrases like “Chana knows...” and “Chana
help them” are commonly used to express threats
or protectiveness. Chanaranach is regarded as an
approachable, practical, and unassuming person in
social settings. She’s rumored to walk beside ordinary
people as equals, never revealing her status.
There is a truth to those rumors. After the Heralds
left the Oathpact, Chana sought a life of peace. She
eventually chose to live as a mortal, taking a husband
and raising five children. But when she was killed
by her daughter, Chana was sent back to Braize (as
are all Heralds upon their deaths). Breaking under
torture, she returned to Roshar, bringing about the
True Desolation.
```

```
Vedel
Vedel, also known as Vedeledev or Vev, is the patron
Herald of the Edgedancers. On Ashyn, she was the
queen of a people who didn’t survive the war between
Odium and Honor. During the Desolations, she
ensured that knowledge of medicine and the healing
arts were shared with humans.
Vedel was the keeper of the keys to immortality,
responsible for extending the lives of the Heralds after
they left Ashyn. In the present day, people sometimes
express astonishment by swearing “by Vedeledev’s
golden keys.”
```

Jezrien and Nale.

HOWARD LYON (TOP); KARLA ORTIZ (BOTTOM)

```
Pailiah
Pailiah, the Herald of Knowledge, was originally named
Pralla. As patron of the Truthwatchers, she was a
champion of scholars and those who seek answers. On
Ashyn, she was one of the future Heralds who served
“Passion,” granting her the power of future sight.
People often use “Pali’s mind” and “Pailiah knew...”
in idioms related to knowledge and scholasticism. Along
with her Truthwatchers, she worked to preserve human
knowledge between the Desolations. However, this
ideal became a compulsion as immortality wore away
at her sense of self. For millennia she has walked among
mortals, stealing from the people she meets and taking
those objects as mementos of their fleeting lives.
The Palanaeum, Kharbranth’s grand library, is
named after her.

Shalash
Shalash, who was originally named Ash, is Jezrien’s
daughter and the Herald of Beauty. “Ash’s eyes” is
commonly used to express shock. Among the other
Heralds, she was known for being outspoken and strong-
willed. While the other Heralds sometimes treated her
like a youth, she had a close relationship with Taln.
Once an unparalleled artist, Shalash is now obsessed
with destroying images of herself, but her mind doesn’t
seem to have deteriorated as gravely as the minds of
her fellow Heralds. As the patron of Lightweavers, she
understands the symbolic power of imagery and its
implications for Cognitive Shadows.
Ash and Talenel traveled together to Emul with
Jasnah Kholin, who sought to question the Heralds
and watch over them.
Battar
The wise and careful Battar is the patron Herald of
the Elsecallers. A counselor and scholar on Ashyn, she
traveled with the other future Heralds to Roshar.
She’s sometimes known as Battah, and the temple
of Battah is one of the oldest temples in Thaylen City.
“Battah send them sense” can express the hope someone
will act wisely, while “sweet wisdom of Battah!” can
serve as an exclamation.
```

```
Under the disguise of an ardent named Dova, Battar
worked to prepare Roshar for the True Desolation
years before it began. She approached Taravangian and
became an agent of the Diagram, though her motives are
unclear. After meeting the other Heralds, Taravangian
questioned Battar’s stability and instructed his followers
not to trust her.
Kalak
Kalak, patron of Willshapers, is one of the most
revered and prayed-to Heralds, alongside Jezrien. Also
like Jezrien, he’s often equated with the Stormfather,
particularly in New Natanan. Kalak is associated with
resolve, community, and truthfulness.
In Vorinism, he’s known as Kelek due to a vowel shift
in Vorin languages. His name is a common expletive,
and he’s invoked in many common Rosharan phrases
such as, “Thank Kelek,” “Kelek help him,” “For Kelek’s
sake,” “Kelek’s breath,” “What in Kelek’s tongue,” and
“Kelek, Jezerezeh, and Heralds above.”
Once celebrated for his good judgment, Kalak
has become paranoid and pessimistic. Whenever he
weighs options, he only considers how everything
could go wrong. Kalak serves as High Judge in the
honorspren city Lasting Integrity, where they call him
Holy One. He also leads the Sons of Honor under the
name Restares, but every step seems to take him closer
to disaster.
```

```
Talenel
Talenel, the Herald of War, is revered in Vorinism as
Stonesinew and the Bearer of Agonies. In his mortal
life, he wasn’t a king or aristocrat like the other Heralds.
He was a horsekeeper and soldier who at first refused
Honor’s offer of immortality. He only accepted when he
understood that the role of Herald would require pain
and solitude, and that if he refused, the burden would
fall to another.
His role in the Desolations became legendary, and
he’s sometimes depicted fighting alone against hundreds
of Voidbringers. Talenel is commonly known by the
nicknames of Taln or Talat; there’s also a devotary in
Alethkar dedicated to him called the Order of Talenelat.
Like the Stonewards who emulate him, Taln is depend-
able, stalwart, and resourceful.
Taln was the only Herald to never break, even when
the other Heralds abandoned the Oathpact and left him
to suffer alone. Now he has returned, his mind fractured
by millennia of torture. He has only had a few moments
of clarity—which he spent rejoicing that his suffering
granted humankind thousands of years to recover
between Desolations.

```
“What a gift you gave them! Time to
recover, for once, between Desolations.
Time to progress. They never had
a chance before. But this time...yes,
maybe they do.”
```

```
Ishar
Ishar, patron of Bondsmiths and among the eldest
of the Heralds, is viewed as one of the most important
Heralds (alongside Jezrien and Kelek). While Jezrien is
considered the leader of the Heralds in the East, Ishar is
considered the leader in the West, where they revere him
deeply. “Ishar be praised” is a common phrase across
Roshar, as is “Tashi above” in the western lands.
Ishar led the human refugees from Ashyn to Roshar,
Connecting the worlds and opening an Elsegate between
them. He was the one who realized the need for the
Oathpact and entreated Honor to grant them that
power—and he also played a key role in abandoning
the Oathpact, leaving Taln to bear its agonies alone.
As Ishar’s mind deteriorated, he succumbed to
megalomania. Ruling Shinovar as “the Voice,” he
misguided the Stone Shamans with his delusions.
In Tukar, he declared himself Tezim, god-priest of the
Almighty. He convinced Nale to hunt down and destroy
Surgebinders to prevent the new Desolation. He sought
a method to forcibly bring spren into the Physical Realm
to fight Odium’s forces, and he even devised a terrible
new method of creating “human Fused.”
Behind this deeply troubled mind is the soul of a
leader who seeks to restore the Oathpact and deliver
Roshar from conflict. But for now, Ishar’s actions
serve Odium.
```

## The Unmade

```
The nine Unmade are ancient, perverse spren who
are Splinters of Odium. They have varying levels of
self-awareness and their powers vary; though some
don’t serve Odium directly, they’re generally harrowing
and twisted.
Most humans believe the Unmade to be horrifying
figments of myth, giving them names like Spirits of
the Void or the Nine Shadows.
It’s unclear how Odium created the Unmade,
including whether they were spren or people before he
corrupted them. The Unmade played specific roles in
the Desolations under Odium’s command, but between
Desolations, they lost their bond with Odium. During
those times, they would either go dormant for centuries
or operate on their own.
The Unmade can be imprisoned in perfect gemstones
by those who possess the right knowledge and tactics.
```

```
Ashertmarn
One of the mindless Unmade, Ashertmarn is often
referred to as the Heart of the Revel. His influence
encourages excess and shirking responsibility.
Ashertmarn appears as a monstrous black heart with
veins snaking into the ground. If people are exposed to
his influence for prolonged periods of time, they often
fall prey to idleness and overindulgence of their vices.
```

```
Ba-Ado-Mishram
Brilliant and ambitious, Ba-Ado-Mishram was the
architect of the False Desolation. While the Fused were
imprisoned on Braize and Odium was unable to inter-
vene directly on Roshar, Mishram took com mand of
Odium’s forces. She created new Regal forms, em pow-
ered them with Voidlight, and wielded Investiture on a
scale that shocked the Knights Radiant.
Mishram’s most audacious move was to claim
much of Odium’s power for herself and, in so doing,
to tie herself to every singer and spren on Roshar.
With this power, she created Regal forms that allowed
singers great power without sacrificing their minds
to the Fused. She marshaled the other Unmade and
formed a Connection between herself and every
singer who held a form.
In that Connection, Mishram saw another oppor-
tunity: unity. Not just between her people, but between
humans and singers. That hope for peace allowed the
Bondsmith Melishi to form a bond with her—a bond
he used to pull her into a perfect gemstone.

```
Chemoarish
Knowledge of Chemoarish, the Dustmother, has been
lost during a long period of apparent dormancy. She’s
presumed to be quite powerful, though her legends vary
widely between cultures. Some wrongly assume she’s
the Nightwatcher, while others associate her with the
disappearance of entire cities during the Desolations.
The Bav people use her name as a curse.
```

```
Dai-Gonarthis
The mysterious Dai-Gonarthis is sometimes known
as the Black Fisher. It’s speculated she was responsible
for the scouring of Aimia but was somehow contained
afterward. She is gifted in Transportation and can create
Elsegates.
Dai-Gonarthis longs for the world’s destruction, so
even Odium hesitates to empower her. If her toll is paid,
however, she possesses the ability to open an Elsegate
large enough to transport an army.
```

```
Moelach
Precognition is Moelach’s domain. Legend says he can
possess the minds of the dying, granting them visions
of awful things to come. The last words of the dying
may sound nonsensical, but the Kharbranthian scholars
who secretly study these “death rattles” have concluded
they’re prophetic.
Ominous sounds such as scratching, scraping, and
heavy breathing are thought to be signs Moelach is near.
```

```
Nergaoul
The Thrill, an exhilarating bloodlust, can be attributed
to the mindless Unmade named Nergaoul. He delights
in carnage, sometimes appearing as a red mist of
clashing and collapsing bodies. Nergaoul’s Thrill can
inspire soldiers to perk up and fight fiercely, regardless
of their exhaustion or dire situation. His power doesn’t
discriminate between sides of a battle—whether by
design or inability—which causes all to be emboldened
by his appetite for gleeful slaughter. The Alethi people
are thought to be especially susceptible to his influence,
and Nergaoul has indeed spent much of the past
millennium dwelling in Alethkar.
```

```
Re-Shephir
Known as the Midnight Mother or Spawning Mother,
Re-Shephir acts on instinct and is attracted to violence.
She produces the Midnight Essence, a tar-like substance
that mimics nearby creatures in an effort to understand
the world.
While her abominations shift forms according to their
environment, Re-Shephir appears as a mass of Midnight
Essence, dark and slick, with faces of screaming people
sprouting like pustules. (For more information on this
Unmade and her Midnight Essence, see “Midnight
Essence” in chapter 8.)
```

```
Sja-Anat
The Taker of Secrets, Sja-anat, “corrupts” spren in
a process she refers to as Enlightening. This injects
Odium-derived Investiture into the spren’s previous
balance of Honor and Cultivation. Lesser spren
corrupted by Sja-anat act as her servants and spies,
though sapient spren touched by Sja-anat seem to retain
their own volition.
In reflected light, Sja-anat appears as a jet-black
shadow pointing the wrong way, with white dots for
eyes. Her motives are as mysterious as her appearance.
While she pretends to be in Odium’s employ, she actively
works against him and encourages her “children” to
bond with Knights Radiant. She seeks to find and
restore Ba-Ado-Mishram.
```

```
Yelig-Nar
Yelig-nar, the Blightwind, is a parasite-like Unmade
who is only visible in the Cognitive Realm and wields
his power from within a gemstone. By convincing a
singer or human to swallow him, he can bond with
them—or if they prove too weak, he consumes them.
Once bonded, the singer or human who does so is
imbued with his power and can Surgebind using nine
of the surges.
The eyes of his hosts glow red, their bodies grow
crystals all over, and a black wind swirls around them.
Though Yelig-nar’s hosts gain incredible power, they’re
quickly consumed by him. (For more information on
this Unmade, see “Servant of Yelig-Nar” in chapter 8.)

## Major Religions

```
Many faiths can be found throughout Roshar, each
with vast differences in what its followers worship and
prioritize.
```

```
Faiths of Roshar
The list below summarizes the primary religions
practiced in different regions of Roshar, then the
following sections detail the biggest of these faiths:
Vorin Nations. Vorinism, the predominant religion
on Roshar, is practiced primarily in Alethkar,
Jah Keved, Kharbranth, New Natanan, and Thaylenah.
Its followers worship the Almighty and the ten Heralds.
Azish Empire. In the kingdom of Azir, most people
revere the Kadasixes—their name for the Heralds.
The faiths practiced in other Azish member countries
vary, but most worship one or more of the Heralds,
the Almighty, or a combination thereof.
Herdaz. Herdazians typically follow a less dogmatic
form of Vorinism with emphasis on community.
```

```
Horneater Peaks. The Unkalaki revere spren whom
they know as the gods of the waters, the gods of the
mountains, and the gods of the trees.
Iri and Rira. The Iriali worship the One. They believe
that the Iriali are the many who’ll one day return to
and become one with their deity. Meanwhile, many
Rirans blend elements of Iriali and Vorin faith with
various Riran folk traditions.
Listeners. While most singers have lost the knowledge
of their people’s faith traditions, they originally
worshipped the “old gods”: primal spren of the night,
the wind, and the stone. The listener culture speaks
of the Fused as cruel gods to fear and spurn.
Purelake. A highly religious people, Purelakers pretend
to worship the god Vun Makak to avoid his spite.
Meanwhile, they secretly worship their true god,
his brother Nu Ralik.
Reshi Isles. Many Reshi live on and worship the Tai-na,
enormous greatshells with habitable shells.
Shinovar. The Shin practice Stone Shamanism, a faith
that reveres spren and focuses on preparing for the
True Desolation.
Thaylenah. Though Thaylenah is a Vorin nation, many
of its people also integrate belief in the Passions into
their worship. This philosophy, which is influenced
by Odium, urges adherents to change their fates by
engaging in passionate desire.
Tukar. Tukar is a theocracy built around the worship of
its god-king Tezim. The Tukari worship the Almighty,
whom Tezim is considered an aspect of.
```

```
Vorinism
Vorinism is one of the primary religions practiced across
Roshar, particularly in the Vorin kingdoms: Alethkar,
Jah Keved, Kharbranth, New Natanan, and Thaylenah.
The religion has a long history of attempting to control
information and exert power across Roshar, but these
aims have been thrown into chaos with the coming of
the True Desolation.
This faith focuses on the worship of the Almighty
(Honor, the creator of humans) and the ten Heralds
(emissaries of the Almighty). Some beliefs vary between
the Vorin nations—for example, some consider Jezrien
and Kalak to be the greatest of the Heralds, even
conflating one of them with the Stormfather.
Many of Vorinism’s core tenets are in service to
its creation myth. According to Vorinism, humans
originated in a paradise called the Tranquiline Halls.
There, they were driven out by the Voidbringers—
wicked creatures from Damnation. The Voidbringers
followed them to Roshar, trying to destroy the humans
or drive them into Damnation, but the humans were
ANTTI HAKOSAARI

```
Religion and Character Development
Religion in the cosmere is a deeply complex and personal
experience, which can add a compelling facet to player
characters and non-player characters alike. From Vorinism
to the Passions to the theocracy of Tukar, orthodoxy
is constantly being challenged in ways that shake
the foundations of Rosharan religions. A character’s
relationship with their religion can be influenced by
both external and internal factors, making it a personal
experience to explore.
Externally, new discoveries and developments can
throw traditional knowledge into question. When
considering a character’s relationship with religion,
examine how story events may (or may not!) shake their
faith. For example, the revelation that the Almighty
is dead—along with other core tenets of Vorinism
being proven wrong—has prompted many to question
the religion’s validity. Many people have withdrawn
their support of the Passions because of the cultural
similarities with the Voidbringers. And meeting a Herald
in their current state may cause a character to question
whether the Heralds are truly semi-divine protectors
of humankind.
Character development or advancement may also
create internal questions. A woman who joins the Knights
Radiant may question the Vorin teachings and strict
gender roles she was raised with. Gaining divination
powers, encountering other religions or cultures, traveling
in nations without a caste system, and similar experiences
may create inner turmoil as a character’s journey clashes
with what they believed to be true.
Consider the following questions when thinking about
Rosharan characters: Why do they follow the religion
they do, and what draws them to it? How strongly do
they adhere to their religion’s orthodoxy? Do they
challenge any teachings—and was this on their own or
because a revelation disproved a core belief? How do
historical events throw their faith into question? Can
they retain their faith while new knowledge of the
Shards, the Heralds, and the Almighty unfolds—and
if not, do they abandon belief entirely or ground their
faith somewhere new?
```

saved by the Heralds, heroes of humankind. These
divine warriors defended the humans ninety-nine times
in eras known as the Desolations, then finally defeated
the Voidbringers in the Last Desolation and banished
them back to the Tranquiline Halls. The Heralds
followed the Voidbringers there and waged war to
force them out of heaven.
The following sections discuss Vorinism as a
religion, culture, and political entity; for more
information on its history, see “Era of Solitude”
in chapter 4.

Core Tenets
Vorinism worships the Almighty as a force of good.
This section discusses some of its core tenets that
Vorins follow in both their faith and culture.

**Callings and Glory**
Vorins must choose a Calling—a talent or skill—
and practice it until they die. In Alethkar, the holiest
Calling is warfare, as Alethi believe they’ll join the
Heralds’ army after death.
Practitioners also choose a Glory—an attribute of
the Almighty to emulate in pursuit of their Calling.
The two are meant to be intertwined; someone with a
Calling of a warrior would desire to choose a Glory of
strength, determination, bravery, or something similar.
After the death of someone who flourished in their
Calling, they’re believed to join the Heralds in the fight
to win back the Tranquiline Halls. There, each faithful
serves in the manner of their Calling; farmers grow
crops for the Heralds, healers tend to the Heralds and
other combatants, warriors fight alongside the Heralds,
and so on. These noble followers are granted powers to
fulfill their Calling in greater measure—for example,
a spearman might create thunder with his shield and
lightning with his spear.
Those who fall short of their potential in their
Calling are instead trapped in a dreamless sleep until
the Tranquiline Halls are won from the Voidbringers.
Meanwhile, those who commit great sins are cast into
Damnation.

**Prayers**
Glyphwards are used to carry prayers, which are
usually written in glyphs on paper or cloth, then burned.
It’s believed that doing so carries the soul of the prayer
to the Almighty (and, at times, the Heralds).

**Oaths**
Vorinism places the utmost importance on oaths.
Entering certain relationships requires all parties to
swear oaths; this can include taking a spouse of any
gender, as well as other forms of partnership.

```
Symmetry
In Vorinism, symmetry is holy. Glyphs and the alphabet
are symmetrical, the Heralds’ names are symmetrical,
and many people’s names are nearly symmetrical—but
not too symmetrical, as that’s impious.
```

```
Chapter 3: Cosmology and Religion 99
```

```
Vorin Culture
The culture of the Vorin kingdoms is based on the book
Arts and Majesty , which outlines “proper” behavior
for men and women. This section presents the core
beliefs from its pages, along with other cultural norms
for Vorins.
Gender Divisions
In Vorinism, only women read, write, and pursue
scholarship. They’re the only ones who can use women’s
script, a written version of the Alethi language; writing
and reading are considered “feminine arts,” along with
other pursuits like painting and music. Some women
serve in the military, though they’re not generally sent
to the front lines. In Vorin cultures, women’s food
prioritizes sweetness.
Women are expected to start covering their left
hand—the “safehand”—when they reach adolescence,
and revealing it is considered obscene. Most Vorin
women completely cover their hands with sleeves or,
less commonly, with gloves. Many women wear a bright
one-piece silk dress known as the Vorin havah. This
dress shields a woman’s safehand from view with a
buttoned cuff on the left sleeve. Among working women
(and in some less rigid Vorin nations), safehands are
generally covered with a glove, and apparel is simpler
and more pragmatic.
“Masculine arts,” meanwhile, include pursuits
like politics and physical labor. Men are forbidden
to read, and their writing is restricted to glyphs that
communicate basic concepts. While Vorin society
doesn’t approve of men becoming scientists or
artifabrians, military officers are encouraged to listen to
books on history and politics. In Vorin cultures, men’s
food prioritizes bold, spicy flavors.
When work involves both “masculine” and
“feminine” arts, a wife and her husband often work
as a team. For example, a woman who owns a shop
typically manages and administers the overall business,
while her husband engages in sales and haggles with
suppliers.
By contrast, ardents of all genders are generally
free from the gender expectations imposed on other
people (see the “Ardentia” section).
Lighteyes and Darkeyes
Vorin culture divides people into two main castes,
determined by the lightness of their eyes. The majority
of people in Vorin nations are members of the lower
caste. These people, called darkeyes, have eyes
```

```
resembling those of most Rosharans: darker shades of
brown, green, blue, gray, or purple.
Members of the upper caste are called lighteyes;
they have eyes in bright shades of tan, amber, emerald
green, glassy blue, and violet. These people believe
their eyes are a mark of superiority to darkeyed people,
and they claim to be closer to the Almighty, more holy,
and more fit to rule than darkeyes.
Many Vorin nations, such as Alethkar, also
implement additional ranks within each caste. In the
“Alethkar” section of chapter 2, see “Caste System”
and the “Eye Color and Castes in Roshar” sidebar
for more information on this hierarchy and its use
of eye color.
This pillar of Vorin culture is driven by half-forgotten
legends and misunderstood history, dating back to the
Desolations when Heralds and Knights Radiant were
marked by glowing eyes.
Vorin Law
Across all Vorin kingdoms, the law protects certain
rights, but only for citizens of higher ranks.
Right of Challenge
The Right of Challenge allows distinguished “lighteyed”
warriors to demand justice from those who have
wronged them through combat. Rank-and-file soldiers
aren’t allowed the same right and can be executed for
attempting to invoke it.
Right to Learn
Most people in Vorin kingdoms—aside from the lowest
nahn rank—can learn professions in any temple of the
Almighty. The largest temples are staffed with ardents
who are experts in an art or trade. These ardents train
all who come seeking to learn.
Right of Travel
People of first or second nahn are considered full
citizens and can freely travel Vorin lands unless they
have joined the military.
```

```
Ardentia
Ardents are Vorin priests, collectively referred to as the
ardentia. They are led by a council of curates who reside
in Valath, a city in Jah Keved, and operate out of the
Holy Enclave. Ardents are under a voluntary contract of
service to lighteyed nobles or to their nation. While not
permitted to possess land or property, ardents are highly
respected and treated well. They can’t participate in
politics or hold office, but they’re given utmost authority
in spiritual matters.
```

**100** Chapter 3: Cosmology and Religion

```
vorin ardenT (lefT)
and curaTe
```

```
Societally, ardents are considered genderless; this
is less about restricting their gender and more about
not needing to define it. Some ardents eschew gender
identities entirely. Doctrine allows them to pursue both
masculine and feminine arts, eat any food, and ignore
gender norms around reading, writing, fighting, and
safehands. Some ardents still feel cultural pressure to
follow the rules of their gender; however, many others
thrive outside the strict gender expectations. This
freedom leads some people to join the ardentia for
personal reasons, rather than as a matter of faith.
In Alethkar, only ardents can use Soulcasters,
something they do with great secrecy. They can also
wield Shardblades, as they teach lighteyed warriors
how to use them.
Devotaries
Ardents are divided into devotaries. These sects prize
different aspects of Vorinism and are meant to aid the
believers’ Callings. Examples of devotaries include the
following:
Devotary of Denial. The Devotary of Denial
emphasizes denying desires and living an austere life.
Devotary of Insight. The Devotary of Insight is
dedicated to the study of Vorin religious texts.
Devotary of Kelek. The Devotary of Kelek helps those
seeking to make difficult judgments or decisions.
Devotary of Mercy. The Devotary of Mercy cares
for those who grapple with their own minds.
Devotary of Purity. The Devotary of Purity is
dedicated to honesty and wholesomeness, and
it encourages the pure pursuit of talents, such as
religious art for painters.
Devotary of Sincerity. The Devotary of Sincerity
is dedicated to seeking truth. It’s one of the smallest
Devotaries, likely because it encourages scrutiny
of everything—even Vorinism itself.
Devotary of Talenelat. The Devotary of Talenelat
honors Taln and focuses on developing a stead-
fast, resourceful spirit. Its followers dislike
theological debates.
```

```
Fall From Grace
During the Era of Solitude, the Vorin church attempted
to assert control and conquer all of Roshar. This
government, known as the Hierocracy, put Vorinism at
odds with many throughout the continent. During that
time, the ardents were determined to control the flow of
information across the world—altering, mythologizing,
and even censoring knowledge to ensure the Hierocracy
could command its subjects.
Predictably, this attempt at global domination has
backfired on the church. Several core tenets of Vorinism
have been shaken by the Everstorm, the return of the
Knights Radiant, and the coming of the Voidbringers.
Contrary to Vorin doctrine, the Almighty (Honor)

```
is dead, the Last Desolation wasn’t the final Desolation,
and the Heralds remain on Roshar with broken minds
and spirits. Vorin leaders continue attempting to force
their hand and maintain control, as exemplified in
Dalinar Kholin’s excommunication. But this hasn’t
stopped the surge of new information and the rising
belief that Vorinism should be abandoned.
```

```
The Passions
Though the people of Thaylenah primarily practice
Vorinism, the Passions are culturally ingrained in
its people as a way of life. The tenets are more of a
philosophy than a formal theology, yet the Passions
are religiously followed.
At its core, the Passions assert that luck and fate
are created by desire—that by wanting something
enough, you make it a reality. In addition, followers
of the Passions derive meaning from events around
them, seeing them as good or bad omens. But even
these omens don’t simply happen; the Passions preach
that your internal attitude guides them. Bad omens are
thought to follow those mired in dread and fear, while
positivity draws good omens.
The Passions and Spren
For followers of the Passions, the existence of spren
reinforces their belief, as spren appear in response to
strong emotions.
```

```
The Passions and Vorinism
In the regions where Vorinism dominates, the Passions
are disregarded and, at times, quietly smothered. Some
Vorins respond with mere skepticism and dismissal,
but others regard the Passions as heretical, pressuring
Thaylen leaders to convert to and practice Vorinism.
When Dalinar was excommunicated, some of these
attitudes shifted. In the wake of his heresy, Queen
Fen of Thaylen witnessed the populace call for the
county to abandon Vorinism for the Passions. Still, this
mindset was restricted to Thaylenah alone, and the
Passions faced another challenge: the return of the
Voidbringers.
The Passions and Odium
The philosophy of the Passions mirrors that of
Rayse, Vessel of Odium, who saw himself as a force
of passion and self-determination. The belief system
dates back to Ashyn, where humans worshipped Odium
as the god Passion; some humans later brought this
belief to Roshar. While modern Thaylens are unaware
of this connection, the religion lost support during the
True Desolation as humans recognized its connection
to the philosophy of Odium’s forces.
```

```
Listener Gods: The Fused
Long ago, Odium empowered some ancient singers
as a weapon in his war against Honor and Cultivation.
Upon dying, these singers were highly Invested with his
power, transforming them into Cognitive Shadows so
they could avoid passing to the Beyond. These immortal
singers—who became known as the Fused—gained
access to the surges, which they channel through
Voidlight, a form of Investiture granted by Odium.
However, this immortality comes at the cost of living
singers, who must willingly sacrifice themselves to
supply the Fused with new bodies. To perpetuate this
cycle of continuous reincarnation, the Fused encouraged
singers to obey them as gods.
```

```
Rejected Gods
Some singers refused to continue the war against
humans and rejected the singer “gods.” These singers
left, abandoning their forms. Calling themselves the
listeners, they settled near the Shattered Plains. To avoid
forgetting their history and forms, the listeners recorded
this information in songs passed down through many
generations.
```

```
fannahn-im
(alTered one)
```

**102** Chapter 3: Cosmology and Religion

```
When modern humans discovered the listeners, a
translation error led the humans to believe the listeners
revered chasmfiends. But the truth was much more
grim: The listeners’ songs taught that the Fused were
terrible gods and the listeners must take every measure
to prevent their return. Consequently, when the listeners
learned King Gavilar Kholin planned to restore the
listener gods and spark a new Desolation, the listeners
arranged his assassination. This led to the War of
Reckoning (discussed in chapter 4).
Return of the Fused
After years of war between listeners and Alethi, Odium’s
sapient Voidspren manipulated listeners into assuming
Regal forms, summoning the Everstorm, and bringing
the Fused back to continue the war against humans.
When listeners continue to resist their gods and
sympathize with humans, the Fused mock them by
calling them “essai”—human lovers, though the term
more literally means hairy.
```

```
Brands of Fused
Each Fused can only access a single surge, determined
by their brand (their type). The Fused Brands table
lists the singer names of the nine brands, the translated
meaning of each, and the surge they can access.
No Fused can access the surge of Adhesion.
For more information on the Fused brands,
see “Fused” in chapter 8.

```

```
Stone Shamanism
The Stone Shamans preach a religion of sin, forgiveness,
and judgment. This faith is based on memories of
history that have been forgotten in other parts of Rosar.
The people of Shinovar revere the spirits of
stones—and other spren—in a land where both are
rare. Stone Shamanism considers many things holy,
including fields, farms, stones, and any metal mined
from the earth. Foreigners aren’t allowed near Shin
fields and farms, and stepping on a stone is considered
a profane act. This reverence dates back to humanity’s
flight from Ashyn, when many refugees carried statues
and stone carvings to remember their lost homeworld.
Over millennia, as memories faded, those cherished
heirlooms became holy relics.
The Stone Shamans’ prohibition against touching
stone is lifted for two groups: the society’s least and most
holy. Shinovar’s ten monasteries are built on stone; here,
both soldiers and Stone Shaman acolytes learn how to
wield steel. Each monastery is led by an Honorbearer,
an elite Stone Shaman who has won and mastered an
Honorblade after intensive ritual combat. Only the
Stoneward Monastery, where acolytes train to emulate
the Herald Taln, has stood for thousands of years
without an Honorbearer.
```

```
The God Beyond
Most, if not all, planets in the cosmere have entities
in their mythology and powers whom they worship
as deities. However, the God Beyond (also known as
the Unknown God) is a force that transcends these
planar deities. Little is known about the God Beyond—
including whether it’s related to Adonalsium or to the
Beyond, the place where souls are drawn after they die.
Rosharans have no formal knowledge of the God
Beyond, but some—such as Dalinar—have intuited
the presence of an “Almighty” greater than Honor.
```

```
A Fused could also will their spirit from
their body, freeing it to seek another host.
Indeed, the humans had tried imprisoning
Fused as a method of defeating them,
but had found it to be futile.

## History of Roshar

```
The True Desolation. The True Desolation is
the modern era of Roshar, which began with the
Everstorm and the return of Odium’s forces. This
period is marked by chaos and war, but also by the
return of the Knights Radiant and the uncovering
of lost history.
```

```
Historical Negationism
One of the greatest tragedies of Roshar’s past is
the “cleansing” of history performed by the Vorin
church during the Hierocracy. Innumerable historical
documents and primary sources were altered to repress
the truth of pre-Hierocracy history.
Knowledge of the Knights Radiant was buried,
obfuscated, or rewritten to fit new narratives pushed
by the church. The Recreance became a failure of
Vorinism, and references to Urithiru, Voidbringers,
and Surgebinding were erased or discredited. The truth
of history was supplanted by mythology, which then
became the common human understanding.
While scholars of the modern era are slowly
uncovering and repairing the damage done by the
Hierocracy, the truth hasn’t always had the opportunity
to be widely disseminated. The information presented
in this chapter is the truth of history as presently known
by some human and singer scholars, undamaged by
the Hierocracy. However, the sections labeled “False
History” provide context for what most humans used
to—or still do—believe about these historical events.
```

```
he world of Roshar, which predates
the Shattering, has a long and storied history.
The significant events of its past pave the
way for modern conflicts—the climactic stage that’ll
determine the fate of Roshar, its people, and perhaps
even the rest of the cosmere.
```

## Scope of History

```
Human scholars commonly divide Roshar’s history into
four major eras, though extant human records have been
significantly shaped by bias and falsification. These eras
include the following:
Prehistory and the Expulsion. This era began at
Roshar’s creation and includes the dawn of the
singers, the Shattering, the arrival of Cultivation and
Honor, and the coming of humans to Roshar. This
era ended at the onset of the First Desolation, when
humans invaded Roshar and came into conflict with
the singers.
The Heraldic Epochs. The Heraldic Epochs began
during the First Desolation, as the Heralds of the
Almighty forged the Oathpact with Honor to seal
Odium’s forces away on Braize. This era was marked
by the cycle of Desolations, the coalition of the
Silver Kingdoms, and the founding of the Knights
Radiant. It came to a close at Aharietiam—which
was supposedly the Last Desolation.
The Era of Solitude. The Era of Solitude began in the
wake of the Last Desolation. This period included the
False Desolation, the Day of Recreance and the fall
of the Knights Radiant, the dissolution of the Silver
Kingdoms, and the rise of the Hierocracy. These
four thousand years were marked by unprecedented
developments in human culture, technology, and
science. This era ended with the War of Reckoning
and the summoning of the Everstorm.
```

```
Secret History
This chapter compiles information revealed in the
first five books of the Stormlight Archive. During the
Era of Solitude, most of Rosharan history is lost or
misunderstood. Many events in this chapter are important
revelations in the novels, which the reader learns alongside
the books’ protagonists. As such, this chapter contains
major spoilers for all five novels. The first sections of this
chapter (“Prehistory” through “False Desolation”) contain
details about the origins of Roshar first revealed in the
fifth novel, Wind and Truth.
```

Chapter 4: History of Roshar 105
```

PETAR PENEV

### Prehistory

```
The prehistory of Roshar belongs to the Dawnsingers,
the singers who lived on Roshar long before the Shards
and humans arrived. Humans have attempted to
rewrite the planet’s origins, centering this era around
themselves.
```

```
Before Humankind
The continent of Roshar was created by Adonalsium
prior to the Shattering. In those times, the world was
shaped by three primal spren: the stone, the wind,
and the night. As far back as its inception, life on
Roshar has been shaped by storms, though they were
less destructive in earlier epochs. The first people to
inhabit the world were the Dawnsingers. These ancient
ancestors of the modern singers worshipped Adonalsium
as the Origin of Songs.
Ten thousand years ago, after the Shattering of
Adonalsium, the Shards Honor and Cultivation traveled
to the Rosharan system. They Invested together
in Roshar, granting the world their pure tones and
creating new spren who responded to more complex
ideas than Roshar's native emotion and nature spren.
```

```
The Dawnsingers understood Honor and Cultivation
to be outsiders to Roshar, and they debated whether to
accept the Shards as gods. Cultivation had no desire to
be worshipped, but Honor felt responsible for the people
whose god they had slain. He granted them the power to
sing songs that could shape the stone itself.
Tanavast and Koravellium Avast, the Vessels of
Honor and Cultivation, loved one another deeply.
However, by residing together on Roshar, they broke
a vow the Shards had made: that they would settle on
separate planets after slaying Adonalsium. That choice
was the first of many that drove a wedge between
Tanavast and the power of oaths and law that he held.
False History
As with much of Roshar’s early history, the Vorin
church obfuscated the truth of the Dawnsingers. Vorin
doctrine asserted that humans were expelled from the
Tranquiline Halls, and the Almighty sent spren called
Dawnsingers to be caretakers of humankind.
This falsehood was refuted when the Eila Stele was
translated, revealing the Dawnsingers were the singers,
Roshar’s first people.
```

```
Ashyn Expulsion
Before arriving on Roshar, humans occupied another
planet in the Rosharan system—Alaswha, later called
Ashyn. Eight thousand years ago, Odium arrived there
and saw a world fit for experimentation. Choosing one
empire to worship him, he called himself Passion and
granted those humans the power to manipulate the
fundamental surges of existence. The empire began a
war of conquest, easily defeating other city-states.
Honor, perceiving Odium’s arrival and machinations,
took immediate action to oppose him. The power of
Honor hated Odium, just as their Vessels Tanavast and
Rayse had always been rivals. Honor granted surges
to the city-states resisting Odium’s empire, but this
only served to escalate the conflict that consumed
Ashyn. Humans chose sides, declared war, and burned
the skies.
Cradling the corpse of a child on the world he helped
destroy, Tanavast felt shame and horror—but the power
he held was content that the people had died with
Honor. Tanavast told himself he would never let the
same fate befall his people.
To escape the burning ruins the humans made of
their home, they opened a portal from Ashyn to Roshar,
the nearest livable planet. Refugees with little more
than stone weapons and the clothes on their backs, they
arrived in the muddy highlands that would eventually
become Shinovar. The men and women who would later
become the Heralds were part of this group, led by the
Bondsmith Ishar.
The Dawnsingers eyed humans with suspicion,
but the outsiders had arrived in a sparsely populated
region. These ancient singers took pity on the human
refugees and kept their distance. They granted that
portion of Roshar to the humans, believing that peace-
ful co existence would be possible.
```

```
False History
Vorinism mythologized the flight from Ashyn to
Roshar. It became known as the Expulsion, when the
humans were expelled from the Tranquiline Halls by
evil Voidbringers, who then followed them to Roshar
and began the cycle of Desolations.
```

```
Odium’s Influence
Relations between singers and humans were peaceful
at first, but Odium’s influence exacerbated growing
tensions between the two peoples.
Humans didn’t easily adapt to Roshar, struggling
to grow plants from Ashyn in the crem-laced mud of
```

```
their new home. A group of malcontent rebels sought
to claim land beyond their allotted borders. When
singers resisted those invaders, humans accused them
of murder. Despite efforts by Ishar and the singer envoy
Elodi, conflict continued to escalate.
Honor and Cultivation confronted Odium, eager to
stop him from igniting another war. They knew that he
had Splintered other Shards, and that their combined
power could stop them. However, Odium demonstrated
that the resulting clash would utterly destroy Roshar.
The Shards agreed to a contract: They wouldn’t oppose
one another directly, and none would give mortals the
unbound powers that brought an end to Ashyn.
False History
Until the advent of the True Desolation, Voidbringers
were largely considered folklore rather than fact. Even
those few who believed in their existence didn’t under-
stand the truth: Humans were the original Voidbringers,
so named for bringing Odium to Roshar.

### Heraldic Epochs

```
The Heraldic Epochs mark the rise of humankind to
dominance on Roshar. Humans, unaware of how much
knowledge was lost during this time, commonly view
this era as Roshar’s golden age.
```

```
First Desolation
The First Desolation wasn’t a continent-spanning war,
but a series of bloody skirmishes as humans sought to
steal land from the Dawnsingers. Wearing furs and
wielding weapons of stone or carapace, the humans
aggressively attacked the singers. It was then that
Odium saw an opportunity: Manipulating certain
singers, he turned their justified anger toward thoughts
of vengeance and reprisal.
Odium offered the singers a priceless weapon in the
fight against human invaders: immortality. He created
the immortal Fused, whose ability to return from death
made them inexorable foes.
Even before the Fused learned to command the
power of Surgebinding, their presence turned the tide
of the war in the singers’ favor. The humans couldn’t
overcome an enemy whose most experienced generals
and champions were unable to truly die.
During this time, Honor and Cultivation didn’t
choose a side between singers and humans. Instead,
they focused on creating new beings in their own image:
the ten orders of sapient spren.
```

```
Oathpact
Decades after their arrival on Roshar, humans found
themselves in a desperate battle against an unkillable
enemy. Ten people—five men and five women—sought
a power of their own. Some had worshipped Honor on
Ashyn, though most had followed Odium. Now they
approached Tanavast, Vessel of Honor, and offered
their allegiance.
Under Honor’s supervision, Ishar forged the
Oathpact. Their number included kings, queens, and—
to stand for commonfolk—a horsekeeper named Taln.
Together, the ten humans created a binding to keep the
Fused from returning. Honor granted them immortality
and surges, like the power Odium once gave them,
but this time limited by oaths to protect Roshar from
Ashy n’s fate.
As part of the Oathpact, Honor bestowed each of
these humans with an Honorblade: a powerful sword
that granted its wielder the ability to manipulate two
of the ten surges.
```

```
These ten humans became known as the Heralds of
the Almighty (see “Heralds” in chapter 3) and changed
the future of Roshar. The Oathpact created a binding
that would remain unbreakable—unless any of the
Heralds broke.
Binding the Enemy
The Heralds knew that by binding away the enemy,
the Heralds would be bound with them. Honor shaped
the world of Braize into a prison, but the Oathpact was
the lock that kept it sealed. During each Desolation,
as long as the Heralds remained on Braize, the Fused
couldn’t reincarnate on Roshar, thus allowing humans
to win the war.
```

```
Cycle of Desolations
Under the terms of the Oathpact, all ten Heralds worked
together to bind Odium’s forces. If a single Herald broke
under torture, fleeing back to Roshar, the Fused would
return. During each Desolation, the Heralds would
train human armies and defeat the Fused, then return
to Braize and endure more torture.
And so the cycle repeated itself: The Heralds
remained hidden on Braize for as long as they could,
but inevitably, they were captured and tortured anew.
When one of them broke, the Fused found new hosts
on Roshar, and the remaining Heralds returned to
lead the human nations. At the start of the Oathpact,
the Heralds were able to endure torture for centuries,
but as millennia passed, their wills began to erode.
```

```
Knights Radiant
“Rayse and I had been in an arms race. First, his Fused,
then my Heralds, then his Unmade, then my Radiants—
which were not my conscious creation, but formed by pieces
of me working independently.”
—Tanavast
With each Desolation, the war between humans and
singers became more dire. In response to the emergence
of the Heralds, Odium created his Unmade and granted
surges to the Fused. However, the balance shifted with
the unexpected appearance of human Surgebinders
on Roshar.
The Surgebinders gained access to surges by bonding
with sapient spren—pieces of Honor and Cultivation.
These powers mimicked the abilities Honor granted the
Heralds through their Honorblades. Though surprised,
the Heralds readily took advantage of this new resource
during the Desolations.
```

**108** Chapter 4: History of Roshar

```
Forming the Orders
The Herald Ishar, working with a human king named
Nohadon, forced a structured organization on the
human Surgebinders. They founded the ten orders
of the Knights Radiant, each associated with one of
the pairings of surges. In time, each Herald became
the patron of the order that represented the surges of
that Herald’s Honorblade. (You can learn about each
Radiant order in chapter 5 of the Stormlight Handbook. )
The Radiants were entrusted with watching for
Desolations. The tower city of Urithiru served as
their center of operations, connected to each of the
Silver Kingdoms by way of the Oathgates. However,
to maintain the ways of war, many Knights Radiant
lived throughout the Silver Kingdom of Alethela
(later known as Alethkar).
Between Desolations, these powerful warriors
defended humankind from threats, such as those posed
by the Unmade (see “The Unmade” in chapter 3).
When a Desolation began and the Heralds came to
Roshar, the Knights Radiant fought alongside them and
the rest of humankind against Odium’s forces. Once that
Desolation ended and the Heralds returned to Braize,
the Radiants helped Rosharans rebuild their societies.
```

```
Ideals of the Immortal Words
The Ideals of the Knights Radiant are Immortal Words
that grant greater shares of power and deepen the
Radiant’s Nahel bond with their spren. These oaths
represent commitments each member of the Knights
Radiant voluntarily enters once they prove themselves
ready. There are five Ideals for each order, but the
First Ideal is the same for all:
“Life before death.
Strength before weakness.
Journey before destination.”
Preparation and intent are the most important aspects
of swearing the Ideals. When a Radiant is ready to speak
the words, they find them in their mind. However,
knowing an Ideal’s words doesn’t permit a person to
swear them if they’re not ready.
It’s not uncommon for an earnest Radiant to only
successfully swear the first three Ideals, as the Immortal
Words become progressively more demanding and
exceptional.
```

SCOTT MURPHY

Last Desolation

The Last Desolation, known as Aharietiam in Vorinism,
marked the end of the cycle of Desolations.
However, it wasn’t a true end. Millennia of torture
on Braize had worn down the Heralds, ever shortening
the length of time between Desolations, until less than
a year passed between the last two.
The Desolation that became known as Aharietiam
ended like many others, with battlefields of corpses on
both sides. This time, however, just one Herald died:
Talenel, the only Herald who never broke and started a
Desolation. The other nine, terrified to endure more tor-
ture, sought a way to forsake their duty. Seeing no other
solution, Ishar begged Honor to change the Oathpact
and allow Talenel to carry its full weight on his back.
Honor allowed it, but this was his last boon. Afterward,
he turned away from humankind, distant and uncaring.
The Heralds’ abandoned Honorblades were later
discovered by a Shin soldier, who retrieved them and
took them back to Shinovar.

```
False History
Vorinism preaches that the Heralds and the Knights
Radiant defeated the Voidbringers ninety-nine times
before casting their enemies back to the Tranquiline
Halls. The Heralds then pursued the Voidbringers,
intent to drive them from heaven as well.
```

### False Desolation

```
Between the Heraldic Epochs and the modern era
of Roshar came two thousand years when the Silver
Kingdoms reigned. It was a time of relative peace when
human and singer civilizations progressed and thrived,
until it ended in a new conflict: the False Desolation.
During these bitter years, the Radiants won an
apparent victory, singers suffered a devastating betrayal,
and Honor was defeated.
Historians estimate that the False Desolation
occurred 2,500 years after the Last Desolation.
During this period, humans and singers clashed
yet again.
```

```
Ba-Ado-Mishram Connects
With the Singers
Since the Fused and Voidspren were still sealed on
Braize, the False Desolation was instigated by one of
the Unmade: Ba-Ado-Mishram (see “The Unmade” in
chapter 3). Mishram found Odium’s Perpendicularity
on Roshar—the pool of power containing his
concentrated Investiture—and took its power for
herself. This also created a powerful Connection
between Mishram and every singer on Roshar.
During this time, singers lived in their own great
cities, but humans occupied much of Roshar. For the
singers, Mishram’s gifts were a chance to tip the balance
of power and reclaim their land. Voidlight and Regal
forms gave singers the strength to oppose the Knights
Radiant. The fighting thus intensified, reminiscent of
the Desolations that came before.
Rayse saw this transpire and recognized that Mishram
was a legitimate rival to his power, but he also saw an
opportunity. He approached Tanavast once more, threat-
ening to fight Honor regardless of the consequences.
Honor desired the conflict, but Tanavast, still clinging
to some compassion, desperately sought a solution that
would protect Roshar. Tanavast proposed a contest
of champions, and Odium agreed on one condition:
Tanavast must agree to eliminate Rayse’s rival.
```

```
Ending the Conflict
As the False Desolation raged on, the Knights Radiant
grew weary of war. The power sustaining Urithiru began
to falter as the Bondsmith Melishi began experi menting
with fabrials that trapped spren against their will.
Neither Honor nor the Heralds were there to aid the
Radiants, and the orders were split by bitter infighting.
Amid this conflict, a Windrunner named Garith
advocated an armistice with the singers. After they
proved willing to negotiate, he convinced a delegation
of Radiants to speak directly with Mishram. At that
meeting, Garith revealed the impetus for his belief in
unity between the two peoples of Roshar: the love he
shared with a direform singer named Shmone.
Moved by Garith and Shmone, Mishram was
ready to negotiate, but then the unthinkable occurred:
Melishi, wielding a perfect gemstone and acting on
Tanavast’s direct orders, attacked Mishram. After
trapping the Unmade, Melishi fled to the Spiritual
Realm to imprison her.
In that moment, Mishram’s imprisonment reverb-
erated through every singer Connected to her. Shmone
and every singer on Roshar dropped to the ground as
their forms and Identity were stolen from them. Their
minds and souls were suppressed, leaving them alive
```

```
but with a diminished ability to act for themselves.
They obeyed orders to survive, asserting themselves
only in minor ways.
This devastating betrayal from Tanavast, who
had already compromised his Ideals so many times,
was too much for the Shard of oaths and bonds. In
that moment, the power of Honor rejected its Vessel,
leaving Tanavast vulnerable to an attack from Odium.
Aftermath
Singers across Roshar, unable to fight or advocate for
themselves, remained without forms. They became
known as parshmen, and for generations, humans
exploited and enslaved them.
Odium believed that he’d killed Tanavast, but a rem-
nant of Tanavast’s soul that held his memories narrowly
escaped. This piece became part of the Stormfather.
Honor’s power continued to be Invested in Roshar
through the highstorms, but Tanavast’s actions brought
an end to the Knights Radiant.
```

```
False History
Vorinism considers the False Desolation a pseudo-
historical event, insisting that no Voidbringers survived
the Last Desolation.
```

```
Day of Recreance
As Tanavast was forsaken by Honor, he touched
the minds of the Knights Radiant. In a tragically
misguided attempt to give them a final warning,
he shared a vision of the future—one in which the
Knights Radiant destroyed Roshar with their surges.
Consequence
To prevent Roshar from meeting the same fate as
Ashyn, the Knights Radiant and their spren agreed
the Radiants should break their oaths. Each of those
Radiants abandoned their Blade and Plate, unexpect-
edly killing their bonded spren as a result. Only one
order didn’t participate: the Skybreakers, who instead
withdrew to ensure the other Radiants never rose again.
Chaos reigned in the aftermath. Humans killed
each other to retrieve the dead spren left behind
as Shardblades and Shardplate. Across Roshar,
people were shocked and enraged by the Radiants’
apparent betrayal.
The spren societies of Shadesmar were even more
grievously impacted by these broken oaths. The
death of so many spren was viewed as genocide.
“Deadeyes” wandered Shadesmar without purpose,
in a tragic parallel to the imprisoned souls of Roshar’s
singers. The remaining sapient spren struggled to
recover their culture and population, and they deeply
resented humans.
```

MICAH EPSTEIN

```
False History
Until recently, it was believed the Knights Radiant
turned on the rest of humankind during the Recreance.
The surviving sapient spren also assumed the Radiants
betrayed their bonded spren, unaware that spren and
Radiants made the decision together.
```

### Era of Solitude

```
The Era of Solitude truly began with the Last
Desolation when Taln was left on Braize as the bearer
of agonies. It encompasses the two thousand years
before the False Desolation, and more than two
thousand years since. However, Vorin scholars don’t
acknowledge the False Desolation, so this term has
become shorthand for the “modern era” after the
Recreance. It was an age when singers were without
forms and humans were no longer Radiant. Humans
continued to fight one another in a near-constant state
of war, and Odium’s machinations paved the way for
his return to power.
```

```
Fall of Kingdoms and Honor
In the wake of the Recreance, Roshar was forever
changed. The Silver Kingdoms were isolated and
collapsed, as they were no longer united by the
Oathgates at Urithiru and supported by the Knights
Radiant. Alethela splintered into princedoms.
Over the next two thousand years, humans
forgot that singers had been a people with their own
civilization and history. Across Roshar, human societies
enslaved the parshmen rather than caring for them.
Shardbearers rose to power, creating an upheaval
of human society. This directly led to the division of
“masculine” and “feminine” arts in the Vorin nations—
as men tried to keep Shardblades and Shardplate out of
the hands of women, the women in turn claimed literacy
for themselves.
```

```
Rise of the Hierocracy
During the Era of Solitude, the Vorin church sought to
unite the entirety of Roshar under a theocracy led by
the ardents. At the height of this Hierocracy’s power,
the church had conquered most of eastern Roshar,
with intentions to spread their influence westward.
To legitimize their rule but obfuscate Vorinism for
commonfolk, the ardents claimed to receive visions
from the Almighty. They also tampered with historical
records, seeking to purge evidence and knowledge of
the Knights Radiant, the Recreance, Urithiru, and even
the existence of Shadesmar. The Vorin church’s revised
version of history became common knowledge.
```

```
War of Loss
To combat the Hierocracy, a man named Sadees, better
known as the Sunmaker, united the princedoms of
Alethkar and waged the War of Loss against the Vorin
church. Weakened by its growing size, the Hierocracy
was cast down by the Sunmaker.
In the aftermath, the Vorin church became
decentralized, and Alethkar took measures to prevent
the church from gaining that much power ever again.
```

```
Legacy of the Sunmaker
After defeating the Hierocracy, the Sunmaker crowned
himself king of Alethkar and sought to conquer Roshar
himself—a dream that failed when he suddenly died.
His empire didn’t last long, fracturing into divided
princedoms as his ten sons warred.
Almost five centuries later, Gavilar Kholin was
inspired by the Sunmaker’s legacy. He united the Alethi
princedoms under his rule with the aid of his brother
Dalinar Kholin and their close friend Torol Sadeas.
CLINT LOCKWOOD
```

```
War of Reckoning
The turning of eras was marked by a conflict known
as the War of Reckoning, waged between the listeners
and Alethkar.
```

```
The Parshendi
After Gavilar Kholin was crowned king of a reunified
Alethkar, he and his brother encountered a group of
listeners while on an expedition south of the Shattered
Plains. Unaware of the history of the listeners and
enslaved singers, the Alethi named them Parshendi,
which translates to “parshmen who can think.”
Gavilar established diplomatic relations with the
listeners and invited them to Kholinar for a feast to
sign a treaty between their two peoples. Most assumed
this was a ploy to claim the listeners’ Shards. In truth,
Gavilar was a member of the secretive Sons of Honor and
sought to incite a Desolation to bring back the Heralds.
```

```
On the night of the feast, Gavilar conveyed to the
listeners that he intended to bring back their “gods”—
the Fused—expecting the listeners to be pleased.
He was unaware their ancestors had intentionally
abandoned the Fused.
```

```
The Assassination
Determined to prevent the Fused from returning,
the Five—the leading council of the listeners—decided
to assassinate Gavilar during his feast. To carry out
the deed, the listeners made use of a Shin Truthless,
Szeth, who wielded an Honorblade.
In a complex web of intrigue on the night of the
feast, Szeth successfully assassinated King Gavilar
Kholin. Due to his attire, the Alethi called him the
Assassin in White.
Three members of the Five spoke on behalf of the
listeners and took responsibility for the assassination.
They were subsequently hanged. At Gavilar’s funeral,
his son Elhokar—the new Alethi king—and the ten
Alethi highprinces swore the Vengeance Pact, declaring
war on the listeners to avenge Gavilar’s murder.

aleThi and lisTener soldiers clash
on The shaTTered plains.
```

```
War on the Shattered Plains
Bent on war, the highprinces led their armies to the
Shattered Plains, each establishing a warcamp in one
of the ten craters along the leeward edge of the region.
Meanwhile, the listeners established themselves in
a ruined city at the center of the Shattered Plains,
naming it Narak.
Due to the Shattered Plains’ terrain, highstorms
made a major assault on the listeners impossible.
Instead, the highprinces besieged the listeners, hoping
starvation would drive their foe to engage them directly.
Gemhearts
Near the beginning of the siege, the Alethi discovered
the value of chasmfiends. These greatshells had massive
gemhearts that were valuable resources for Soulcasting,
providing the Alethi armies with needed food and
materials. However, the listeners also used these
gemhearts to grow their crops. The highprinces and
listeners raced to reach each pupating chasmfiend—
either extracting the gemheart before the other army
arrived or engaging in battle.
Over time, the Alethi army’s unity crumbled as the
highprinces began competing among themselves to
reach gemhearts before the other highprinces. Before
long, the desire for competition and riches distracted
them from the Vengeance Pact.
Battle of the Tower
Seeking to unify the highprinces, Dalinar Kholin
coordinated with Highprince Torol Sadeas in hopes
of defeating the listeners at the Tower plateau, though
that battlefield favored the listener army. Rather than
cooperate as planned, Sadeas and his men abandoned
Dalinar’s army at the Tower, leaving them to die.
Dalinar, his son Adolin, and their soldiers were
only rescued due to the intervention of Kaladin Storm-
blessed and the men of Bridge Four (see “Kaladin and
Bridge Four” in chapter 5). In the wake of Sadeas’s
betrayal, Dalinar deepened his commitment to uniting
the highprinces and fulfilling the Vengeance Pact.
To that end, he forced King Elhokar to name him
Highprince of War. Dalinar also confronted Sadeas
and exchanged his Shardblade in exchange for all
2,600 of Sadeas’s enslaved bridge crew, including
Kaladin and Bridge Four.
```

```
Stormform
While the Alethi armies were embroiled in political
tensions and disunity, the listeners were faring no better.
The long conflict had taken its toll on the listeners
and their dwindling numbers. Their general and
Shardbearer, Eshonai, sought to finally end the war and
arranged a diplomatic meeting with Dalinar.
However, Venli—a listener scholar and Eshonai’s
sister—had other plans. Years prior, when Gavilar first
met the listeners, Venli received a gemstone from the
worldhopper Axindweth containing a Voidspren named
Ulim. Taking advantage of Venli’s ambitious and jealous
nature, Ulim maneuvered her into manipulating
the listeners.
Venli pretended to be researching mediationform,
but in truth she was capturing stormspren. A few days
before the scheduled meeting with Dalinar, she sought
to persuade the listeners into adopting a long-lost form
of power—stormform. Despite initial resistance, the
listeners eventually agreed, aware they would eventually
lose the war with the Alethi.
Eshonai volunteered to be the first to take on
stormform. Influenced by the stormspren inside
her gemheart, Eshonai tyrannically took charge of
the listeners, pushed them to adopt stormform, and
undermined her own peace talks.
A small group of listeners refused to take on storm-
form. Fleeing the threat of execution, these dissidents
escaped east through the chasms along with Venli’s
mother, Jaxlim.
```

```
Waves of Change
The ongoing troubles on the Shattered Plains weren’t
the only significant events happening on Roshar.
Princess Jasnah Kholin was seemingly assassinated by
the Ghostbloods, but in truth, she escaped to Shadesmar
using the surge of Transportation.
Across the continent, a few brave Radiant spren—
aware of a coming catastrophe—crossed into the
Physical Realm and started forming Nahel bonds,
creating new Surgebinders.
The Herald Talenel arrived in Kholinar, having
returned to Roshar without breaking under torture.
He tried to warn of the oncoming Desolation but
was dismissed as a madman.
```

**114** Chapter 4: History of Roshar

```
GAL OR
```

King Taravangian of Kharbranth, creator of
the Diagram—a brutal and cryptic plan to unite
humankind—assassinated Rosharan world leaders
through the Assassin in White. This triggered civil war
in Jah Keved, leading to Taravangian becoming king of
that nation as well.
These events pushed and pulled against the fabric
of Roshar, precursors to the conflict that would soon
plunge the continent into further chaos.

The Battle of Narak

In response to the failed peace talks, Dalinar and
three other Alethi highprinces joined forces to assault
Narak, the listeners’ seat of operations at the center
of the Shattered Plains. The Alethi armies were
accompanied by Shallan Davar, Jasnah Kholin’s ward.
She sought an Oathgate she speculated was in Narak,
which could transport them to the legendary
city of Urithiru.

```
Once the Alethi armies reached Narak, they
engaged in battle with the listeners’ stormform army.
During the skirmish, Shallan discovered the Oathgate.
Meanwhile, Adolin Kholin—Dalinar’s son—defeated
Eshonai in combat, pushing her into a chasm
where she would later drown.
The Everstorm
Despite the Alethi emerging triumphant from battle,
the stormform listeners succeeded in summoning the
Everstorm—a new Invested storm of Odium that travels
the opposite way across the continent. As the Everstorm
began to move, the Stormfather also summoned an
unforeseen highstorm, hoping to destroy all involved in
this debacle and wipe the slate clean. The two storms
collided over Narak, decimating the Alethi forces.
Kaladin Stormblessed, the leader of Bridge Four,
confronted the Assassin in White in the sky above

### True Desolation

```
After the arrival of the Everstorm, the world entered
a time of global war that ushered in the era of the
True Desolation.
```

```
A World at War
Following the Battle of Narak, the Everstorm swept
across Roshar—and in so doing, it restored Identity and
Connection to the soul of every enslaved singer on the
continent. Additionally, this storm of Odium returned
the Voidbringers to Roshar. The Fused possessed the
bodies of all surviving stormform listeners—save Venli,
whom Odium spared as the “Last Listener.” Voidspren
gathered the newly awakened singers, leading them to
the Fused to join Odium’s army.
The Everstorm, traveling the opposite direction
to a highstorm, threw Roshar into chaos. Amid this
turmoil, Alethkar was seized by Odium’s overwhelming
forces, becoming occupied territory as the Voidbringers
pushed toward Kholinar.
Monarchs and Radiants
As a new era—the True Desolation—began, the Alethi
refugees from the Shattered Plains settled within
Urithiru, ancient home of the Knights Radiant. Dalinar
Kholin bonded the Stormfather, becoming a Bondsmith,
and officially refounded the Knights Radiant.
Afterward, Dalinar sought to create an alliance
of major world leaders, aiming to secure allies in the
fight against Odium and to gain control over more
Oathgates. His initial overtures were rejected by
all but Taravangian, now king of Kharbranth and
Jah Keved. Taravangian accepted this alliance to
manipulate Dalinar, plotting to unite all humans under
Taravangian’s control in accordance with his Diagram.
```

```
Securing Urithiru
The new occupants of Urithiru slowly uncovered its
secrets. One such discovery was the presence of the
Unmade Re-Shephir (see “The Unmade” in chap-
ter 3). Shallan—a Lightweaver—threatened her with
support from Adolin and Bridge Four. Shallan was
ultimately able to chase Re-Shephir from the tower,
freeing Urithiru from the Unmade’s influence.
Within the basement area Re-Shephir had occupied,
Dalinar’s younger son Renarin discovered an archive
of gemstones—each containing records left by the
old orders of Knights Radiant.
Not long afterward, Jasnah unexpectedly returned
to her family and allies, having escaped Shadesmar.
```

```
Roshar’s Timeline and Storytelling
Choosing when to set your Rosharan campaign is a
significant decision. The events depicted in the first five
novels of the Stormlight Archive cover the end of the Era of
Solitude (in The Way of Kings and Words of Radiance ) and
the advent of the True Desolation ( Oathbringer, Rhythm of
War , and Wind and Truth ). Consider which era is the best
starting point for your campaign, as the world of Roshar
changes dramatically once the True Desolation begins.
The end of the Era of Solitude provides a backdrop for
more personal stories, especially ones of self-identity
and personal healing. The wide-reaching consequences
of the True Desolation provide heroic opportunities
with global stakes. If your group is interested in a longer
story, following a narrative that transitions from the
Era of Solitude into the True Desolation could give your
characters a chance to be part of the return of the Knights
Radiant. Entire campaigns could take place during the year
of upheaval following Oathbringer.
Alternatively, you could set a campaign at some
point during the history of Roshar, such as during the
False Desolation. The novels reference and sometimes
depict events from earlier eras, but many details—such
as dates, concepts, and specific events—have yet to be
fully explored. If your play group doesn’t mind working
with fewer canonical details, a setting like this allows for
considerable creative freedom.

Coalition of Monarchs
Despite initial setbacks, Dalinar persisted in reaching
out to other Rosharan leaders. Using his new skills as
a Bondsmith, he was able to convince both Queen Fen
Rnamdi of Thaylenah and Prime Aqasix Yanagawn
of Azir to join his alliance—thus finally forming the
foundation for his Coalition of Monarchs.

Oathgates and Armies

While many recipients of Dalinar’s overtures either
ignored him or simply refused to join the Coalition
of Monarchs, the nation of Iri wrote back that they
decided to join with the Voidbringers.
Dalinar’s coalition initially sought to reinforce
Jah Keved from invasion, but they eventually
realized the enemy’s true target was Thaylen City.
At the same time, Elhokar set out to save his wife
and son, as Kholinar had gone dark in the middle
of the Voidbringers’ occupation of Alethkar, and no
spanreed communications were functioning.

```
Fall of Kholinar
Near the end of the War of Reckoning, Alethkar’s capital
city of Kholinar erupted into riots when Queen Aesudan
executed an ardent for accusing her of negligence and
debauchery.
Led by Elhokar, a small strike team left Urithiru to
investigate Kholinar and activate its Oathgate. They
arrived to find the city besieged by the Voidbringers,
with Voidspren and Fused deliberately destroying
spanreeds in the city.
Two Unmade—Sja-anat and Ashertmarn—had
influenced the city. A third, Yelig-nar, was bonded by
Aesudan, though she was consumed by his power after
the strike team confronted her. Despite the strike team’s
best efforts to seize the palace, the Fused breached
the city, Elhokar was slain, and Kholinar fell to the
Voidbringers.
```

```
Battle of Thaylen Field
Meanwhile, the Coalition of Monarchs nearly dissolved.
Taravangian orchestrated the release of terrible
revelations about Roshar’s history. This pushed Azir to
abandon the coalition, leaving Alethi and Thaylen forces
to defend the city alone.
On the arrival of the Everstorm, Odium unleashed
the bloodlust known as the Thrill, which was actually
the Unmade Nergaoul; this turned the Alethi troops
under Meridas Amaram’s command against their
coalition’s armies.
In the midst of the battle, Odium sought to claim
Dalinar as his champion but failed. Dalinar used his
Bondsmith powers to unite the three realms—Physical,
Cognitive, and Spiritual—and opened Honor’s
Perpendicularity, declaring “I am Unity.” This infused
every gem in the city with Stormlight, empowered the
Knights Radiant, and allowed reinforcements from
Shadesmar.
Seeing this, Odium fled. Radiants trapped Nergaoul
in a perfect gemstone, and the Voidbringer army was
routed from Thaylen City. During this battle, Venli
swore the First Ideal, taking her first step away from
servitude to Odium.
```

```
Looking Ahead
As noted in this book’s introduction, the Stormlight World
Guide uses the year after Oathbringer as its default
setting. Other chapters look back on the Era of Solitude
and describe life just after the arrival of the Everstorm. The
remaining sections of this chapter are the only parts of this
guide that directly reference the events that transpire in
Rhythm of War and Wind and Truth.
```

```
A New Normal
Despite earlier setbacks, the Coalition of Monarchs
reunited in the aftermath of the Battle of Thaylen Field.
Over the following year, the coalition’s armies became
better acquainted with fighting against the Fused and
Odium’s forces.
Developments in fabrial science led to the creation of
a flying airship. The coalition acknowledged Dalinar as
king of Urithiru, and Jasnah was subsequently crowned
queen of Alethkar. Her consort was Hoid, a worldhopper
who disguised himself on Roshar as a sharp-tongued
jester named Wit.
In addition, the Knights Radiant rescued a famous
Herdazian general—the Mink—and secured an alliance
with Herdaz, bringing them into the coalition’s fold.
Two initiatives were then undertaken: The coalition
agreed to push into Emul to strike at Odium’s forces,
and the people of Urithiru organized an envoy into
Shadesmar in hopes of convincing the honorspren to
bond more Windrunners.
```

```
Occupation of Urithiru
Not long after the coalition armies left for Emul, one
of the Fused—Raboniel, the Lady of Wishes—led
an offense on Urithiru and captured the tower. She
pressured Navani Kholin, now a captive, to help her
study Light. Together, Navani and Raboniel created
Warlight. They also rediscovered anti-Investiture, in
the forms of anti-Voidlight and anti-Stormlight (see
“Science and Technology” in chapter 1).
Odium’s forces were finally routed from Urithiru
through the combined efforts of Kaladin Stormblessed
and a rebellion within the Voidbringer ranks—the
latter of which was undertaken by Venli and a Fused
named Leshwi.
Raboniel was killed and Navani bonded the Sibling,
the spren of Urithiru, becoming another Bondsmith.
Envoys to Shadesmar
Within Shadesmar, the Urithiru delegation reached
Lasting Integrity, the stronghold of the honorspren.
The honorspren immediately rejected the delegation,
so in hopes of changing their minds, Adolin Kholin
offered himself up to be put on trial for the Recreance.
The trial revealed a divide within the honorspren:
the older generation had instituted the isolationist
policy, but the younger generation wanted to bond
Radiants and fight Odium.
The gathered spren were shocked when the
deadeye of Adolin’s Shardblade—the cultivationspren
Mayalaran—was partially revived through the bond
```

```
The armies started charging the
wall. No pause, no breather. Odium
would keep pushing forces at this
wall as long as it took to crack
Thaylen City.
```

**118** Chapter 4: History of Roshar

```
PETAR PENEV
```

Adolin forged with her. She caused an uproar when
she testified that the Recreance wasn’t a betrayal, but a
mutual decision between the old Knights Radiant and
their spren. This revelation ultimately resulted in the
young generation of honorspren being allowed to bond
new Radiants.

Battle of Emul
During the coalition’s advance on Emul, Odium
convinced Taravangian to turn the forces of Jah Keved
on the rest of the army. The rest of the coalition
anticipated such treachery and cleanly dealt with
the betrayal.
Under the expert command of the Mink, the
coalition’s armies secured a victory in Emul. Odium
met with Dalinar under terms that Wit helped set, and
the two agreed to a contest of champions. If Odium’s
champion won, he’d claim Roshar and take Dalinar as
his general. If Dalinar won, Odium would be forced to
withdraw for another thousand years.
Shortly thereafter, Szeth killed Taravangian in a fit
of anger. However, before he died, Taravangian drew
Nightblood and used it to consume Odium’s Vessel;
upon doing so, Taravangian Ascended and became
the new Vessel of Odium.

```
Contest of Champions
With just ten days left until the contest of champions,
Dalinar determined he needed to claim Honor’s power
to defeat Odium. He and Navani entered the Spiritual
Realm in search of answers, joined by other Radiants:
his daughter-in-law Shallan, his son Renarin, and
Rlain (the listener member of Bridge Four). They
were followed by two Ghostbloods, Iyatil and Mraize,
who hoped the Bondsmiths would lead them to the
Ghostbloods’ own goal: the prison of Ba-Ado-Mishram.
The Ghostbloods’ interference sent Dalinar’s mission
awry. Lost in the Spiritual Realm, Dalinar and Navani
were unable to lend their aid to the coalition for two
crucial weeks.
```

```
Surprise Attacks
The coalition had hoped for a reprieve leading up to
the contest of champions, but Odium had other plans.
The contract he signed with Dalinar would freeze the
borders in place at the time of the contest, but that gave
Odium ten days to claim as much of Roshar as he could.
```

Adolin discovered this treachery during a mission to
Shadesmar, as he saw Odium’s troops moving through
the Cognitive Realm. He rushed to the defense of
Azimir while the Windrunner leader Sigzil led efforts
at Narak and Jasnah commanded Thaylen City. Each
was a bastion of power for the coalition, and now
their forces were split trying to defend against a final
overwhelming attack.

Journeys of Discovery
Kaladin, the hero who had led the coalition to victory
in previous battles, was on another mission: to travel
with Szeth to Shinovar and cleanse the Shin of their false
leaders. Advised by Wit, Kaladin understood his mission
was to provide emotional counsel to Szeth—and possibly
even to Ishar himself. The Skybreaker and Windrunner
flew together to Shinovar, where Szeth claimed the
Honor blades from each Stone Shaman monastery. A
sense of profound wrongness pervaded the nation, and
the Honorbearers became shadows of their former selves.
On the other side of Roshar, the Willshaper Venli
found her lost people: the listeners who rejected

```
stormform. They were approached by chasmfiends,
who they discovered they could communicate with.
Thude wrote a song to record this remarkable discovery.
Venli formed a group of new Willshapers, working
with Fused like Leshwi who had turned their backs
on Odium. They traveled together with the chasmfiends
toward the new battle at Narak.
Lessons of History
The Radiants lost in the Spiritual Realm experienced a
series of visions that conveyed the lost history of Roshar.
Dalinar learned of why Tanavast had weakened over
time, and of the terrible betrayal that broke him—
but also of the world-ending consequences of wielding
Honor’s power.
While Shallan overcame her Ghostblood mentors,
Renarin and Rlain came to understand singer history.
They reached the conclusion that Ba-Ado-Mishram
must be freed.

With his final breaths, as a tempest assaulted him,
Dalinar sent love and courage to those most closely
Connected to him.
The Night of Sorrows
Taravangian quickly realized his victory wasn’t as
complete as it seemed. He moved to destroy Gavinor
but found Odium’s hate held in check by Honor’s
principles. Taravangian had expected to spend
centuries building an army on Roshar before taking
his war to the cosmere, but as Retribution, he couldn’t
hope to escape the notice of other Shards. The flow
of time on Roshar slowed, distorted by the massive
energies unleashed at the birth of Retribution. During
Roshar’s next decade, the rest of the cosmere would
have around eighty years to prepare for war.
Still, Taravangian had won this battle, and
Retribution reigned on Roshar. With the Stormfather
destroyed, the Everstorm was unopposed by
highstorms. The surviving Knights Radiant would
now be without Stormlight. Only Azir, Urithiru, and
a few plateaus in the Shattered Plains had escaped
the Voidbringer armies. Cultivation fled Roshar and
her perpendicularity closed. Worst of all, Retribution
claimed the nascent spren of the Blackthorn, shaped by
the collective terror of people throughout Roshar, who
had thought of Dalinar’s younger self as something akin
to a terrible force of nature. Dalinar himself was beyond
Retribution's reach, but this version of him would be a
loyal general to lead Retribution’s armies to the stars.
Hope lives on despite this time of darkness. Dalinar
and Navani’s children have survived. Rlain and Venli
have proven that singers and humans can stand united.
Ba-Ado-Mishram is free. Urithiru remains a Radiant
stronghold. And in Shinovar, Kaladin took his next step,
becoming a new Herald.
```

```
What Comes Next
The Stormlight Handbook and the Stormlight World
Guide encompass the first five books of the Stormlight
Archive, but they don’t reveal the stories that can be told
in a world where Stormlight itself is now in short supply.
As new novels are written, the Cosmere RPG will grow to
incorporate new character options and lore.
Until that time, the end of the Era of Solitude and the
year leading up the True Desolation are a rich setting for
storytelling. Campaigns can also extend into the wider
cosmere with the help of other Cosmere RPG releases like
the Mistborn Handbook and online supplements. As the
Night of Sorrows approaches, will your characters stay to
defend Roshar, or will they cross into Shadesmar and find
an entire universe of adventure?
```

```
Last Stand
With the calculating brilliance of its new Vessel,
Taravangian, Odium scored victories as nations across
Roshar surrendered to his forces. Those nations
included coalition allies Emul, Tashikk, and—in spite
of Jasnah Kholin’s concerted efforts—Thaylenah. An
army of singers and Fused overwhelmed the Oathgate
in Azimir, overpowering the Azish army.
A few stood strong. The Knights Radiant, led by
Sigzil, managed to hold the Shattered Plains until just
before the final day. Venli and her listeners, having
secured a secret treaty with Jasnah, switched sides and
held Narak for themselves. Emperor Yanagawn, assisted
by Adolin Kholin and ten deadeye spren, managed to
retake his throne room and hold Azir for the coalition.
In Shinovar, Kaladin and Szeth faced Nale, then
Ishar. Szeth swore the Fifth Ideal of the Skybreakers
and wielded Nightblood to defeat Ishar’s “human
Fused” Honorbearers. Kaladin found a new connection
to the primal windspren of Roshar, and he helped both
Heralds confront the delusions afflicting them.
```

```
The Contest of Champions
When the contest of champions arrived, Odium revealed
his champion, Gavinor—Dalinar’s five-year-old
nephew, except Gavinor was now older, having spent
years in the Spiritual Realm training under Odium.
Dalinar, refusing to kill even one innocent to save his
world, sought another solution. In the same moment,
Renarin and Rlain freed Mishram from her prison in
the Spiritual Realm. The power of Honor, which had
eschewed humans for millennia because of Tanavast’s
betrayal, returned to Dalinar.
As the new Vessel of Honor, Dalinar was
overwhelmed by its Intent. Honor demanded to oppose
Odium directly, even if it meant mutual annihilation.
Mountains shook and cracked as Taravangian and
Dalinar harnessed the power of Odium and Honor.
But Dalinar had learned not only from his life of
violence and redemption, but also from his time in the
Spiritual Realm, where he saw the mistakes Tanavast
made by trying to reconcile his own humanity with the
deific power of a Shard. Dalinar rejected that power,
renouncing his oaths and breaking every contract
between Honor and Odium.
Dalinar’s gambit relied on understanding his foe
and the nature of power. As he predicted, Taravangian
claimed Honor’s unbound power for himself.
Combining the power of two Shards, Taravangian
became Retribution, the most powerful being in the
cosmere. Retribution rejoiced, but Dalinar’s plan had
worked: Across the cosmere, the other Shards turned
their attention to Retribution, resolving to stop him.

Character Connections
This section provides some guidance for using canonical
organizations and individuals to draw the PCs into
a cohesive group. However, the players can certainly
create their own networks of new connections that aren’t
detailed in the books. Roshar is a vast international
stage, and the PCs can find unlikely allies and
dangerous enemies anywhere.
Patrons and Mentors
Canonical characters can be used to support PCs both
personally and distantly. Bridgemen might be defended
by Kaladin or promoted to soldiers by Dalinar. Scholars
could be aided by Shallan or Jasnah, or artifabrians
might be given monetary support and oversight
by Navani.
The game master (GM) can include any of these
people as a non-player character (NPC), but players
and GMs also have the option to tie them directly into
the rules for patrons and mentors; see chapter 8 of
the Stormlight Handbook for guidance on using patron
amenities and similar rewards. A Surgebinder can be
mentored and taught by a canonical Surgebinder of
their order—Windrunners by Kaladin, Lightweavers
by Shallan, Truthwatchers by Renarin, and so forth.
And if a PC is interested in becoming a Surgebinder
but hasn’t yet bonded a spren of their own, they might
gain a Knight Radiant as a patron and become a squire
to that order, gaining early access to the power of their
surges while they are in proximity to their patron (as
discussed in chapter 8 of the Stormlight Handbook ).
```

```
Seeking Allies
Characters in dire straits may need to seek aid, which
can be given in many ways. PCs researching a mystery
may be directed to Jasnah Kholin—or be tempted into
the waiting arms of the secretive Diagram, who could
claim to see the future for them. PCs seeking military
aid could seek out Dalinar Kholin, Bridge Four, the
Knights Radiant, or another group, depending on
their needs.

he Era of Solitude and the True Desolation
are shaped by key figures who tug the threads
of fate in different directions, plunging Roshar
into chaos. Yet despite the importance of these powerful
entities to Roshar’s future, the narrative of the Storm-
light Archive series continuously asserts the necessity
of unity, cooperation, and connection. These themes
are present everywhere—in the heart of Bridge Four, in
the communal rhythms of singer society, in the bonds
between Surgebinders and spren, in the forming of
the heroic Knights Radiant, and elsewhere.
In this world, being a hero means trusting others
and trusting oneself, growing alongside those who are
also growing. This chapter discusses the main figures
on the Stormlight Archive’s global stage, exploring
their significant achievements and the connections
they offer player characters. The chapter also presents
organizations that characters can join—or conflict with,
depending on their actions and ideals.
```

## Using This Chapter

```
No matter what shape your campaign’s allies and
organizations take, relying on them will help Roshar feel
like a living, interconnected setting. And as the player
characters (PCs) make allies and enemies in this global
conflict, the PCs can become important nexuses as well.
PCs can connect with these figures and groups in
many ways. They might gain patronage or mentoring
from individuals or organizations, seek allies to solve
problems or combat a threat, bond with friends through
adversity, or integrate these figures into their personal
history or future aspirations.
Each entry’s “Goals and Rewards” section overviews
the benefits of allying with and supporting that
individual or organization. In addition, these entries
discuss their history, achievements, specialties, and
areas of oversight, providing details to help connect
them to your narrative.

Bonding Through Adversity
Adversity brings strangers together. This could
happen in an obvious way, such as through the War
of Reckoning or the True Desolation, but there is
potential in any ally or organization. Bridge crews can
suffer and bond with Bridge Four, and Surgebinders
can fight alongside and receive aid from the Knights
Radiant. But what about characters who can glimpse
the future? Or characters who have lost many loved
ones? Characters like Renarin and Kaladin provide
empathetic allies who can understand and provide
unique perspectives on a PC’s challenges.
```

```
Recruited
When the True Desolation begins, many people—
important people—begin seeking recruits for their
causes. Surgebinders may be swept up into Dalinar’s
Knights Radiant, but he’s hardly the only one looking
for allies.
The organizations in the second half of this
chapter (including Odium’s forces, the Diagram, the
Ghostbloods, the Skybreakers, the Sons of Honor, and
the Worldsingers) are most dynamic when used to either
recruit the PCs into their schemes or to actively oppose
them. For example, if the Diagram deems the PCs
dangerous to their cause, the party may be targeted by
assassins, while the Ghostbloods might try to recruit
skilled PCs into their ranks.
Singer PCs may find themselves pulled in opposite
directions—Venli may try to gather them away from the
Voidbringers, while the Fused may try to sway them to
join Odium’s side in the war.
```

```
A Moment in Time
This chapter includes backstories for several of the
Stormlight Archive’s key characters. In keeping with the
overall setting of this book, it summarizes these characters
as they existed during the year following Oathbringer.
For the events of Rhythm of War and Wind and Truth ,

```

### Coalition of Monarchs

```
The Coalition of Monarchs is an alliance of nations
on Roshar that works to oppose Odium and the
Voidbringers following the True Desolation. Founded
by Dalinar Kholin after the Battle of Narak, this
coalition includes Urithiru, Alethkar, Azir and its
member states, Herdaz, Jah Keved, Kharbranth,
and Thaylenah. Urithiru serves as the coalition’s
headquarters.
```

```
Dalinar Kholin
The Alethi king of Urithiru, Dalinar Kholin, also serves
as leader of the Knights Radiant. He’s a Bondsmith of
the Third Ideal who has bonded the Stormfather.
In his youth, Dalinar was a very different man.
Known as the Blackthorn, he was heavily addicted
to the Thrill and sought only to kill, carrying both
immense pride and a fearsome reputation. Today,
he has taken responsibility for his past wrongdoings,
becoming a man of deep honor who strives to lead
Roshar wisely. His Calling is to be a leader, his Glory
is determination—and though the Vorin church has
excommunicated him, he has never wavered in his
duty to Roshar.
```

```
An Unstable Union
Dalinar’s commitment to the people of Roshar led him
to form the Coalition of Monarchs in an attempt to
unite humans against Odium. Convincing the leaders
of other nations proved a difficult task, but it culminated
in the first meeting of monarchs. In addition to Dalinar
and Navani Kholin, attendees included leaders from
Alethkar, Azir, Emul, Yezier, Tashikk, Thaylenah,
Kharbranth, and New Natanan, as well as guards,
scribes, interpreters, and guests. The meeting devolved
into arguments, but attendees calmed when Dalinar
promised to send troops to Jah Keved.
Unbeknownst to Dalinar, Taravangian—the leader
of Jah Keved—was working to steal the coalition from
him. Dalinar sought to mobilize forces to the true target
of Odium’s forces, Thaylen City. However, Taravangian
released explosive information about Roshar’s history,
manipulating the other leaders into doubting Dalinar’s
motivations. The Azish abandoned the coalition, as
did Jah Keved.
```

**124** Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations

```

```

Coalition Reformed

Despite this setback, Dalinar successfully organized
Alethi troops and aided the Thaylens in defending
Thaylen City from Odium’s army. Following this
victory, the Azish rejoined, though wary of Dalinar.
Taravangian also returned, still plotting to take control.
The coalition organized a successful expedition to
Akinah, claiming new Soulcasters. Meanwhile, fabrial
research led to stunning new inventions, and the
coalition commanded the southern seas following the
Thaylen navy’s victory. After this string of successes,
the coalition officially recognized Dalinar as king of
Urithiru, with the stipulation that he renounce any
ambition to rule them.

Current Members

Following Taravangian’s betrayal in the Battle of
Thaylen Field, Kharbranth declared itself neutral
and Jah Keved sided with Odium. Dalinar’s remaining
coalition members include Urithiru, Alethkar, Herdaz,
Thaylenah, and Azir and its member states. However,
Alethkar and Herdaz are occupied by the Voidbringers.

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using the Coalition of Monarchs in your
campaign, individual PCs who complete goals for them
may be able to gain them as a patron, and in so doing,
gain their patron benefit.
Patron Goals
The coalition might offer goals like the following:
Recruit for the Coalition. Find and recruit a
meaningful new member for the coalition. This
could be a faction that isn’t already allied with
them, or someone with skills the coalition needs.
Spy on Odium. Discover key information on
the movements and plans of Odium’s forces
around Roshar.

### Jasnah

```
Few have dedicated themselves to history as much as
Jasnah Kholin, the queen of Alethkar, a leading scholar
of her time, and an Elsecaller of the Knights Radiant.
Born to Gavilar and Navani Kholin, she was changed
forever by the assassination of her father. On that dark
night, she plunged into Shadesmar, witnessed Szeth
defy gravity and murder Gavilar, and learned the
listeners sought Gavilar’s death because of his plans
to bring back their gods.
From then on, she became a historian first and a
royal second, seeking information about the Assassin in
White and drawing parallels between the listeners and
the Voidbringers. Jasnah had always been a scholar,
but now she risked heresy to uncover the truth about
Roshar and her own abilities as a nascent Radiant.
```

```
“A woman’s strength
should not be in her role,
whatever she chooses it
to be, but in the power
to choose that role.”
—Jasnah
```

**126** Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations

```
JULIA MADDALINA
```

```
In the Action
One of Jasnah’s greatest strengths is her unwillingness to
sit idly by. Instead, she seeks out experiences, expands
her knowledge, and aims for self-betterment. While
she sees herself as a scholar first, she throws herself into
dangerous situations to train her skills as a Surgebinder
and Shardbearer.
At her best, Jasnah encourages others to be their
best and to never accept what seems to be true and
inevitable. Her philosophies have undoubtedly shaped
the future of Roshar.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using Jasnah in your campaign, individual PCs
who complete goals for her may be able to gain her as a
patron, and in so doing, gain her patron benefit.
```

```
Patron Goals
Jasnah might offer goals like the following:
Veristitalian Research. Uncover a
previously undis covered piece of
history and present it to Jasnah’s
network of Veristitalians.
Break Down Alethi Institutions.
Help increase equality in Alethkar
by breaking down a vestige of its old
institutions.
```

```
Patron Benefit: Jasnah
In addition to offering amenities,
Jasnah can provide you with access
to a spanreed network of deeply know-
ledgeable scholars around Roshar. After
a long rest during which you can access
a spanreed to Jasnah and her network,
you can choose one cultural or utility
expertise you don’t already have. You
temporarily gain that expertise until
after your next long rest. (If you gain
the Erudition talent from the Scholar
path, this expertise counts as being
granted by Erudition.)
Alternatively, Jasnah can take you on
as an Elsecaller squire instead of granting
the above benefit. However, she’s very
selective in her choice of squires.
```

```
Unparalleled Scholar
Jasnah is a Veristitalian—a member of a scholarly
order dedicated to reconstructing the facts of history,
unmarred by bias or misunderstanding. Jasnah’s notes
predicted the parshmen were Voidbringers and the
Desolation was coming; later, she discovered humans
were the original Voidbringers. Her work led to the
rediscovery of Urithiru and much information about
Radiants, and she paved the way for Shallan to save
thousands on the day of the True Desolation.
As a leader and scholar, Jasnah possesses wisdom,
passion, and thoughtfulness. Often stern and sometimes
curt, she has alienated some and been ostracized by
others due to her atheism, and the Vorin church has
branded her a heretic. Though uncompromising and
confident, she isn’t so stubborn as to believe she can’t
be wrong. With her vast network of scholars, Jasnah
is adept at unearthing information when questions
or problems arise.
```

```
Knight Radiant
Jasnah is the only known Elsecaller on Roshar, and
she was the first modern Radiant to achieve the Fourth
Ideal. Her bond with the inkspren Ivory allows her to
access the surges of Transformation and Transportation.
These empower her in Soulcasting skillfully without
using a Soulcaster, hunting information, and trans-
porting herself and others to and from Shadesmar.
```

```
Queen of Alethkar
Jasnah defied Vorin tradition to become queen of
Alethkar as a ruler in her own right, rather than through
marriage. After King Elhokar’s death, she was chosen
for the throne, as neither Dalinar nor Adolin Kholin
wanted to take the throne.
Since becoming queen, she has worked closely with
Dalinar and the Coalition of Monarchs to oppose
Odium’s forces. She has also shattered institutionalized
traditions throughout Alethkar, opposing the caste
system and pushing for the abolition of slavery.
```

```
Relationship With Hoid
Following Jasnah’s return from Shadesmar, she and
the worldhopper Hoid became romantically involved.
They share a deep mutual admiration for each other’s
intelligence and curiosity. Hoid also admires Jasnah’s
careful paranoia, through which she has avoided
numerous assassination attempts. (Hoid is further
described in the “Worldsingers” section at the end
of this chapter.)

## Kaladin and Bridge Four

```
Kaladin Stormblessed is an Alethi soldier and a
Windrunner of the Knights Radiant. He has bonded
the honorspren Sylphrena and sworn the Third Ideal.
Many people admire Kaladin for his intense desire to
protect others and for his natural leadership. Kaladin
has struggled with melancholy and self-doubt for most
of his life, and he has applied his skills as a healer to
treating others who face similar feelings of despair.
```

```
Surgeon and Slave
Kaladin was born to Lirin and Hesina in northwest
Alethkar. Kaladin assisted his surgeon father over the
years, though he yearned to be a soldier.
After his younger brother Tien was conscripted,
Kaladin enlisted in the army to protect Tien—but
a string of tragedies followed. Tien was placed
on the front lines as bait and died. Thereafter,
Kaladin dedicated himself to training to
protect others. He saved the life of Highmarshal
Meridas Amaram, and in so doing, won a Shard-
blade and Shardplate from his foe—but Kaladin
refused to wield them, giving them to one of his men
instead. Amaram coveted the Shards and stole them
for himself, covering up his deeds by ambushing
Kaladin and selling him into slavery.
```

```
Bridge Four
Almost a year after being enslaved, Kaladin
was sold into Highprince Sadeas’s army. There,
he was assigned to Bridge Four, the crew with
the worst casualty rate. Kaladin grew close to
them, trained them, and bonded with them,
renewing the crew’s lost hope.
When Kaladin prioritized his men’s
safety over winning a battle for Sadeas,
Kaladin was strung up outside during a
highstorm to receive the Stormfather’s
judgment. Against all odds, he survived,
gaining the reverence and loyalty
of his men.
From then on, “Bridge Four”
became a rallying cry—a place for the
downtrodden, a family for men sent to die.
Even as Kaladin and his men were freed from
slavery and rose to become Dalinar’s soldiers,
Windrunners, and Knights Radiant, most
clung to the loyalty they felt to Bridge Four
and to Kaladin, the man who protected them
when no one else would.
```

```
“Honor is dead,
but I’ll see what
I can do.”
—Kaladin
```

**128** Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations

**bridge four symbol**

```
Bridge Crew
Bridge Four’s notable original members include
Kaladin, Lunamor (also known as Rock), Moash, Teft,
Skar, Sigzil, Dabbid, Drehy, Hobber, Leyten, Lopen,
and Rlain. (Teft, Rock, and Moash are no longer with
Br idge Fou r.)
After transferring to Dalinar’s warcamp, the crew’s
roster has expanded, adding Prince Renarin, Colot,
and several women—Lyn, Kara, and Laran, among
others. Most noteworthy of all, the members of Bridge
Four have joined the Knights Radiant and are now
Windrunners.
```

```
Anger and Vengeance
Kaladin’s life is marked by protectiveness and bravery—
but also bitterness and prejudice. He has suffered at the
hands of many nobles and he clings to a deep distrust
of lighteyes. Consequently, when he became a Knight
Radiant and his eyes glowed with blue light, he despised
himself. He has only recently begun to overcome this
hatred, largely through knowing people like Dalinar,
Adolin, and Shallan.
```

```
Despair
Through most of Kaladin’s life, he has wrestled with
feelings of dejection and hopelessness. These challenges
are heightened when sunlight is scarce, such as during
the Weeping. Kaladin also struggles with the weight
of others’ high expectations; self-doubt plagues him,
and he believes he’s cursed to survive while ruining
everything he touches. He feels each loss deeply and has
only recently begun to realize that saving everyone is
impossible, and that he isn’t responsible for the deaths
around him.
```

```
Syl
Beyond Kaladin and Sylphrena’s relationship as
Surgebinder and spren, she acts as his guide and
confidant—perhaps even his best friend. Syl strives to
understand concepts such as grief, sorrow, and loss so
she can empathize with and support her dear friend in
the darkest of times.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using Kaladin and Bridge Four in your
campaign, individual PCs who complete goals for them
may be able to gain them as a patron, and in so doing,
gain their patron benefit.
```

```
Patron Goals
Kaladin and Bridge Four might offer goals like the
following:
Build Bridges. Help a member of Bridge Four
reestablish contact with someone from their life before
their time in the bridge crews.
Locate Squires. The Windrunners are always looking
for worthy squires. Locate someone who embodies the
Ideals of the Windrunners and recruit them into the
order’s ranks.
Patron Benefit: Kaladin
and Bridge Four
Bridge Four doesn’t have access to the normal
amenities of a patron. However, if you can get in
touch with Urithiru, they can dispatch a member
of the Wind runners to fly your group across Roshar.
This Windrunner won’t knowingly fly you into any
kind of danger or enemy territory that would require
Gravi tation tests to navigate. The amount of time it
takes for them to arrive and help you is at the GM’s
discretion based on your current circumstances. The
Windrunner Flight Frequency table lists how often
you can call for this help, depending on your tier.
Alternatively, one of the members of Bridge Four
can take you on as a Windrunner squire instead of
granting the above benefit.

JULIA MADDALINA (LEFT)

## Shallan

```
Shallan Davar is a Veden scholar and a Lightweaver
of the Knights Radiant. Witty, clever, and brave, she
discovered Urithiru and saved her allies during the
rise of the Everstorm. Though Shallan has faced great
adversity, she’s learning not to be suffocated by her past,
and instead to boldly stride toward the future.
```

```
Early Life
Shallan’s childhood was shaped by violence. Her mother
and a Skybreaker acolyte discovered that young Shallan
had bonded a Cryptic and spoken Ideals. The two tried
to kill her, but Shallan instinctively slew them with her
Shardblade. After her mother’s death, Shallan sought
forgetfulness and withdrew from her Shardblade—
which severed her bond and turned her Cryptic into
a deadeye.
Shallan’s father became cold and abusive, and after
many years of violence, Shallan killed him too.
The trauma of Shallan’s childhood influenced much
of her life, causing her to regress in her Ideals. It would
be many years before she spoke them again.
```

```
Personas
To navigate precarious or frightening situations, Shallan
develops separate personalities that she can escape into.
These compartmentalized identities help her to meet
new challenges with whichever traits and knowledge
will best support and protect her. Using her Lightweaver
abilities to craft different appearances for each, she
has long relied on these personas. However, Shallan
is increasingly self-aware and doesn’t withdraw into
her personas as often, now using them as a tool rather
than a desperate escape. Shallan’s personas include
the following:
Veil. Veil protects Shallan from her worst memories
and interacts with the Ghostbloods—an organization
Shallan was caught up with while pretending to be a
member’s apprentice (see “Ghostbloods” later in this
chapter). Veil acts as a con artist and spy, throwing
herself into daring, dangerous plans.
Radiant. Radiant allows Shallan to fit the ideal image
of a Knight Radiant. She’s serious, disciplined, and
thoughtful, and—unlike Shallan—she cares little for
what other people think of her.
Formless. Rather than being a full personality, Formless
is more of the person Shallan believes she must be,
a coping mechanism to distance herself from her
self-loathing. Veil is trying to help Shallan realize that
Formless is just part of herself, a Shallan she doesn’t
want to face after the deaths she has caused.
```

```
Scholarship and Artistry
Shallan is an eager scholar who shows a great interest
in the world around her. She often stops to “take a
Memory” of things that fill her with wonder—such as
when she managed to sketch a santhid, a rarely seen
creature. Her Calling pertains to natural history, and
thus she makes many notes on the world around her,
cataloging and capturing it in her drawings.
Over time, she has developed considerable artistic
talent. Her Memories allow her to exactly reproduce
images she has captured on paper, but even without
```

**130** Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations

```
JULIA MADDALINA
```

```
using this ability, she has a good memory and great
artistic skill. She uses her drawings to aid in her
illusions, as she finds it easier to hold an illusion if
she draws it first.
```

```
Relationship With Adolin
Shallan is married to Adolin Kholin. They met when
Jasnah arranged a causal betrothal between them to give
Shallan the means to save her family’s finances. The
two were quickly taken with one another and have since
developed a deep trust, sharing their darkest secrets
with one another. They were married by the Vorin
church after the Battle of Thaylen Field.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using Shallan in your campaign, individual
PCs who complete goals for her may be able to gain her
as a patron, and in so doing, gain her patron benefit.
Patron Goals
Shallan might offer goals like the following:
Undermine the Ghostbloods. Infiltrate the
Ghostbloods or otherwise uncover a key piece of
information about them that Shallan can use. (She
plays a constant game of cat and mouse with the
Ghostbloods, though it’s often unclear who is in
which role.)
```

```
Patron Benefit: Shallan
In addition to offering amenities, Shallan can provide
help from one of her Lightweavers from the Unseen
Court. If you can get in touch with Urithiru while in a
location where a Lightweaver could safely and quickly
reach you (such as a city with an Oathgate or an area
where a Lightweaver might be operating), a Light-
weaver can meet you after you finish a long rest and
apply Lightweavings to a number of members of your
group up to your current tier. These Lightweavings last
for 4 hours, and if they would be opposed by another
character, the wearer of the Lightweaving rolls a skill
test using a modifier based on their current tier, as
shown on the Opposed Lightweaving Tests table.
Alternatively, Shallan can take you on as a Light-
weaver squire instead of granting the above benefit.

### Szeth

```
Szeth-son-Honor is a Shin man and a skilled assassin.
While wielding Jezrien’s Honorblade, he was the
infamous Assassin in White. He has since bonded with
a highspren named 12124 (who bears a number for a
name, as is highspren tradition), becoming a Skybreaker
of the Third Ideal in Dalinar’s service. Szeth now wields
both a Shardblade and Nightblood, a sentient sword.
As an ally, Szeth is loyal, serious, and respectful.
His combat skills are largely unparalleled, and he can
kill quickly and effectively.
At the age of twenty-seven, Szeth was named Truth-
less after attempting to lead a rebellion against the
Voice controlling the other Honorbearers of Shinovar.
As Truthless, he followed only the commands of his
“master”—whomever held his Oathstone. He has long
relied on different masters to guide his thinking, most
recently Taravangian and Dalinar. He’s learning to rely
on himself, but he sees himself as an irredeemable killer.
```

```
Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations 131
```

JULIA MADDALINA

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using Szeth in your campaign, individual PCs
who complete goals for him may be able to gain him as
a patron, and in so doing, gain his patron benefit.
```

```
Patron Goals
Szeth might offer goals like the following:
Relic of Home. Procure the special tea and incense
used in meditation by Shin Stone Shamans.
Patron Benefit: Szeth
Szeth doesn’t have access to the normal amenities of a
patron. However, he has a deep well of knowledge about
the surges, which he gained from practicing with the
Honorblades in his youth. If you gain Szeth as a patron
and train with him during downtime (see “Downtime”
in chapter 9 of the Stormlight Handbook ), you can gain
the Shardblade expertise. Additionally, for each day
you spend training with him, you gain an advantage
you can use on a future surge skill roll. You can’t gain
more of these advantages than your highest rank
in a surge skill, and these advantages last
until you use them or next train with Szeth.
```

### Renarin

```
Truthwatcher Renarin Kholin
has struggled to find his place. A prince of House
Kholin and the second son of Dalinar and Evi,
he felt most at home with Bridge Four. His mistspren,
Glys, was “Enlightened” by the Unmade Sja-anat,
granting Renarin visions of the future. The Vorin
church condemns future sight as evil, so he entrusts
the secret of his power to very few.
As a Knight Radiant, Renarin is thoughtful, loyal,
inquisitive, and courageous. His future sight and
his Progression surges have aided many. He often
volunteers knowledge of niche subjects, and his visions
are immensely valuable despite only offering possible
outcomes, not certain ones. Renarin has paved the
way for other Radiants to bond with corrupted spren,
allowing for more seers—and more black spots in
Odium’s own future sight.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using Renarin in your campaign, individual
PCs who complete goals for him may be able to gain
him as a patron, and in so doing, gain his patron benefit.
```

```

### Lift

```
Lift is a Reshi Edgedancer and a thief enshrouded in
mysteries. After a difficult childhood in Rall Elorim, she
sought the Nightwatcher, but instead, she unknowingly
gained an audience with Cultivation herself. After
requesting to “stay the same,” Lift gained a unique
ability to exist partially in the Cognitive Realm and
to metabolize food into Lifelight, fueling her surges.
As a child, Lift used her “awesomeness” and her
cultivationspren, Wyndle, to survive as a thief in Azir.
She narrowly avoided being killed by the Herald
Nale several times. The last time she encountered him,
she spoke her Third Ideal and convinced him there was
no use in killing Surgebinders, as the True Desolation
had come. She has joined the Knights Radiant and now
resides in Urithiru.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using Lift in your campaign, individual PCs
who complete goals for her may be able to gain her as a
patron, and in so doing, gain her patron benefit.
Patron Goals
Lift might offer goals like the following:
Find New Cuisine. Locate a food Lift has never tried
before. It’s okay if it’s a little stale by the time it gets
to her—she’ll still eat it.
```

```
Patron Benefit: Lift
Lift doesn’t have access to the normal amenities of
a patron. However, she has the uncanny ability to
“acquire” whatever might be needed. Once per week,
if Lift is available and willing, you can request that
she acquire something for you, but it’s up to the GM
whether she can do so. For example, while she’s capable
of entering heavily guarded locations, she might not
be able to obtain certain plot-critical items—knowing
Lift, she’s likely to instead get distracted by a new type
of chouta.
Alternatively, Lift can take you on as an Edgedancer
squire instead of granting the above benefit.
```

```
Patron Goals
Renarin might offer goals like the following:
Touch of Sja-anat. Locate a person who has bonded
another spren Enlightened by Sja-anat—or bond one
yourself—and introduce them to Renarin.
```

```
Patron Benefit: Renarin
In addition to offering amenities, Renarin can provide
you with insights into the future. After a long rest during
which you can access a spanreed to Renarin, roll a
number of d20s equal to your tier and record each result.
When an enemy or willing ally you can sense makes a
test, you can use a reaction to replace the test’s d20 roll
with one of your recorded numbers. You can replace that
number after you see their die roll and after they apply
any advantages, but you must do so before the effects of
the test are resolved. You lose a recorded number after
you use it to replace a d20 roll or after a long rest.
Alternatively, Renarin can take you on as a Truth-
watcher squire instead of granting the above benefit.

## Venli

```
Venli is a listener scholar and Willshaper, bonded
with her lightspren Timbre. She was a keeper of songs
and developed the listeners’ writing system. Venli is
credited for rediscovering nimbleform and stormform,
though her knowledge of the forms came from the
Voidspren Ulim.
For some time, Venli was Odium’s foremost
propagandist, but she eventually felt remorse for
summoning the Fused and wished she could be more
like Eshonai, her sister. Since that confession, Venli
has been trying to draw singers away from the Fused,
gathering them to desert the Voidbringers.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using Venli in your campaign, individual PCs
who complete goals for her may be able to gain her as a
patron, and in so doing, gain her patron benefit.
Patron Goals
Venli might offer goals like the following:
Liberate Singers. Identify singers who want to be free
of Fused control, then help them escape and contact
Venli and the listeners.
```

```
Patron Benefit: Venli
Venli can provide you with connections to singers who
resist Odium’s authority, and she can provide amenities
when you’re traveling in areas inhabited by singers.
Additionally, she can teach you much about Fused
society because of her time working for them. When
using her knowledge while in Odium-held territory, you
gain an advantage on various tests based on your tier, as

### Navani

```
Navani Kholin is the former queen of Alethkar, widow
of Gavilar Kholin, wife of Dalinar Kholin, and the
Coalition of Monarchs’ leading mind in fabrial science.
She’s mother to Jasnah and Elhokar Kholin (by birth)
and Adolin and Renarin Kholin (by marriage). Though
an insightful scholar, Navani is an orthodox theist and
traditionalist; this presents challenges as she seeks to
reconcile her beliefs with the remarkable discoveries
occurring before her very eyes.
With her political cunning, scholarly mind, and
access to both scholars and fabrials, Navani is a valuable
ally for any character.
```

```
Dalinar’s Visions
Dalinar trusted Navani to record his visions, and
she excelled at the task. Navani realized his rambling
was too ordered to be nonsense, so she researched
his babbling and realized he had repeated a phrase
from the Analectics—a book of chants written in the
Dawnchant, the language of the singers. Using Dalinar’s
visions, Navani jump-started the project to translate the
Dawnchant.
She published Dalinar’s visions (after removing
sensitive information) and added historical references
to support his descriptions. Later, she taught Dalinar
to read and write, helping him with his autobiography
Oathbringer, My Glory and My Shame.
```

```
Scholar and Artifabrian
Navani is a renowned scholar and artifabrian who has
been pivotal in the development and refinement of new
fabrials, including grandbows and the painrial. Navani
once doubted herself as both a scholar and artifabrian,
seeing herself as a mere patron of these sciences.
However, her skills proved highly valuable to Alethkar,
as her designs for a painrial and a floating archery
platform appealed to their militaristic priorities.
When most of Alethkar moved to Urithiru, Navani
led the way in uncovering much about the ancient
city. She discovered and deciphered the workings of a
fabrial lift. When Renarin found an archive of inscribed
gemstones in the library of Urithiru, Navani used
vibrations to reveal recorded messages from the ancient
Knights Radiant.
Navani is currently leading a team of ardents and
engineers in the creation of Roshar’s first airship, the
Fourth Bridge. A hundred feet long, sixty feet wide,
and forty feet high, it will move through the air using
hundreds of conjoiner fabrials.
```

```
“Merely another
problem to solve,
through application
of logic and hope,
in equal measure.”

JULIA MADDALINA

Goals and Rewards

If you’re using Navani in your campaign, individual PCs
who complete goals for her may be able to gain her as a
patron, and in so doing, gain her patron benefit.

Patron Goals
Navani might offer goals like the following:

**Fabrial Breakthrough.** Make a discovery in fabrial cre-
ation. This could be a new device or a new interaction
that unlocks new potential for fabrial technology.
**Unearth Ancient Secrets.** Uncover secrets of fabrials
from before the Recreance.

Patron Benefit: Navani
In addition to offering amenities, Navani can provide
you with access to the best equipment and facilities for
crafting fabrials, granting an advantage on crafting tests
when using facilities she provides or recommends.
Additionally, Navani can provide you with a powerful
fabrial or gemstone suitable for your party’s tier (see
“Fabrials and High-Quality Gems” in chapter 8 of the
_Stormlight Handbook_ ). The specifics of this reward are
at the GM’s discretion. When you return to Urithiru or
otherwise meet up with Navani, you can swap out the
fabrial and gemstone for a new one.

## Odium’s Forces

```
The Shard Odium has at his disposal an array of
dangerous allies, from the Unmade and Fused to
individual humans and singers he has manipulated.
Odium’s forces seek to conquer all of Roshar, but this
is merely the prelude to a larger war. Odium has always
sought to make Roshar a world torn by war, a crucible
in which to forge the cosmere’s fiercest warriors.
```

```
Voidbringers
Throughout history, Odium’s elite forces have
been called Voidbringers, though the term was
misunderstood during the Era of Solitude. As the
True Desolation begins, that term refers to the
Fused, Regals, Voidspren, and Unmade.
Fused
The Fused are ancient, immortal singers whose souls
can take over the bodies of willing singers.
Fused are undoubtedly at the heart of the True
Desolation and unfolding global events, as they’ve
```

**leshwi, vyre, and lezian**

```
served Odium for millennia. Some have become
unstable, stretched thin by so many Returns, but
many are brilliant leaders and scholars. (For more
information on the nine brands of Fused, see their
profiles in chapter 8.)
Regals
Regals are singers who have bonded with a lesser
Voidspren to assume a singer form of power (see
“Singers and Listeners” in chapter 2). Each form
grants a different ability, from the deadly lightning of
stormform to the prophetic visions of nightform.
In singer hierarchy, Regal is the highest rank aside
from the immortal Fused, whom other singers serve
dutifully. Only singers who prove especially capable and
loyal are given the opportunity to become a Regal.
```

```
Voidspren
Voidspren are spren composed of Odium’s Investiture.
Most are lesser Voidspren who exhibit only simple or
instinctive intelligence, such as stormspren (who bond
with singers to create stormform) and secretspren
(crackling orbs of yellow energy who “scream” when
fabrials or surges are activated).
Though less common, there are intelligent sapient
Voidspren with memories dating back to the human
arrival on Roshar. One such Voidspren, Ulim, manip-
ulated the listener Venli into causing the Everstorm.
In Shadesmar, Voidspren have seized several spren
cities and expanded Odium’s influence using warships
and Fused patrols. In the Physical Realm, they track and
monitor independent groups of singers, guiding them to
the Fused to be converted to Odium’s cause.
Unmade
The ancient Unmade are among Odium’s most
fearsome and powerful forces. These nine Splinters
of Odium are each endowed with formidable abilities
such as corrupting spren, influencing the emotions
of an entire region, or seeing the future. Some are
intelligent, showing cunning and patience, while others
are mindless forces of wrath. (See “The Unmade” in
chapter 3 for more information on the Unmade.)
```

```
Thunderclasts
Thunderclasts are enormous stone monsters who
serve Odium and fight at the front of his forces.
Though they have a physical form, each is controlled
by a Cognitive Shadow who animates stones around
them. Thunderclasts appear throughout history,
dating back to the Desolations, and they’ve slain
Radiants—and even Heralds—countless times.
(See “Thunderclast” in chapter 8 for more info rm-
ation on these gargantuan entities.)
```

```
Singer Allies
When humans first arrived on Roshar, many of them
had served Odium in the war that destroyed Ashyn.
Odium sought a new people to manipulate and
empower—and he found the singers. When humans
encroached on singer lands, Odium shaped the singers’
frustration into fury. Over the ensuing centuries and
millennia, he repeatedly tempted them with power
and guided them toward war.
With the return of the Everstorm and the awakening
of singers across Roshar, Odium knew he had another
chance to harness the singers’ righteous anger and
wield it as destructive wrath. Employing the Fused
as overseers and lieutenants, he drafted formerly
enslaved singers into an army of warform soldiers
and empowered Regals.
However, not all singers accept Odium’s rule.
Some celebrate him as a liberator, giving them the
chance to reclaim their rightful home. Others see
him as just another master demanding to be obeyed,
and they have no interest in fighting his war. Each
singer’s experience is individual, and some have
even sworn to oppose him as Knights Radiant. (For
more information, see “Singers and Listeners” in
chapter 2.)
```

```
Human Allies
Odium has many human allies and puppets across
Roshar. While Taravangian was his most effective
servant, he also manipulated individuals like Queen
Aesudan, Meridas Amaram, and the former bridgeman
Moash. Some human nations have capitulated to
Odium’s overwhelming power, while others have been
destroyed by infighting that Odium orchestrated.
The Skybreakers—the only order of Knights Radiant
who didn’t disband at the Recreance—have also found
themselves serving Odium. Supporting the singers’
claim to Roshar, they joined the war on the side of
the Voidbringers.
```

```
Voidbringer Objectives
The Voidbringers pursue many smaller objectives
while they advance their primary goal: conquering
Roshar for Odium. Voidspren bond with singers to
bring soldiers into Odium’s army. The Fused maintain
power by capturing and controlling strategic areas such
as Alethkar, Urithiru, and the Oathgates. The Fused
and Voidspren both spread their influence through
Shadesmar, converting spren to their cause. Fused,
```

```
Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations 137
```

DAARKEN

```
Regals, and thunderclasts fight on the frontlines
against the Coalition of Monarchs. With many
tactics at their disposal, Odium’s Voidbringers now
command vast regions of Roshar, leaving the humans
scrambling to respond.
However, the Voidbringers aren’t a monolith and
their goals sometimes differ. For example, some seek
a military victory while avoiding collateral damage,
while others aim to drive humans to extinction.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
Odium’s forces often play an important role in
campaigns, usually as the main adversary. However,
individual PCs may wish to align themselves with
Odium. Such PCs may be able to complete goals for
Odium’s forces to gain them as a patron, and in so
doing, gain their patron benefit.
```

```
Patron Goals
For PCs who are willing to risk association,
Odium’s forces might offer goals like the following:
Spy on Dalinar’s Coalition. Discover key information
on the movements and plans of Dalinar and his
coalition, then report this information to the Fused.
```

Patron Benefit: Odium’s Forces
In addition to offering amenities, Odium’s forces can
offer great power to singer and human characters.
**Singer Benefit.** As a singer, you gain the Ambitious
Mind talent from chapter 2 of the _Stormlight
Handbook_. If you later break your ties with Odium’s
forces, you lose this talent and can’t benefit from later
talents in the tree until you regain this talent through
other means.
**Human Benefit.** As a human, you gain a Voidspren
who accompanies you. Though you can’t bond with
this spren, they follow the rules in “Playing With
**raboniel leads deepesT ones** Spren” in chapter 5 of the _Stormlight Handbook_.
**in The invasion of uriThiru.**

### The Diagram

```
In hopes of saving Roshar from the Everstorm and
the True Desolation, King Taravangian of Kharbranth
approached Cultivation (whom he believed was the
Nightwatcher) and asked for the compassion and
acumen to save the world. Cultivation granted him both,
but with a curse: He would never possess both to their
fullest at the same time. On any given day, he might be
brilliant but heartless, or compassionate with a clouded
mind, or an entirely unremarkable blend of the two.
One fateful day, Taravangian awoke with incredible
genius, allowing him to determine the likely course of
future events—and thus to devise a plan to save human-
kind from the True Desolation. He covered his bedroom
walls and furniture with writings and calculations.
After these enigmatic writings—which he called the
Diagram—were copied into one volume, Taravangian
gathered people he trusted to aid in deciphering and
interpreting it. Thus the group of the same name was
formed. The members of the Diagram believe that
correctly interpreting and carrying out the Diagram
will unite and save humankind. However, Taravang-
ian’s actions have thus far destabilized much and
saved nothing.
```

```
The Text
The Diagram is written in codes, diagrams, poetry,
and invented languages. This slows down the process
of interpreting it, as it first must be translated into plain
speech, and these translations can get muddied and
allow for multiple interpretations. Members sometimes
disagree on what they think the Diagram is instructing
them to do, and each member acts based on their
individual interpretations.
```

```
Death Rattles
To sharpen their understanding of the future, the
Diagram systematically analyzed “death rattles”—
the last words of dying people. These prophecies of
the future come from an ancient spren of Odium, the
Unmade Moelach. To expedite the collection of death
rattles, Taravangian enacted one of his most callous
policies: he bled hospital patients to death.
Obsessed with obtaining even more prophecies,
Taravangian instituted a program to take hospital
patients whose disappearances wouldn’t be noticed—
the terminally ill, the vulnerable, the forgotten. They
were slowly and intentionally bled to death while Silent
Gatherers recorded the death rattles.
After Moelach settled elsewhere on Roshar, death
rattles became less frequent, restricting Taravangian’s
access to them.
```

```
“The Diagram has served its
purpose. We have protected
Kharbranth. We have fulfilled
the Diagram. Both the book and
the organization we named after
it were merely tools.”
```

```
Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations 139
```

PETAR PENEV (LEFT); ARI IBARRA (RIGHT)

```
Allying With Odium
Continuing to follow the Diagram, Taravangian
confronted Odium, offering to ally with him if Odium
promised to save the people of Kharbranth. When
Odium agreed, Taravangian gave his forces Jezrien’s
Honorblade.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using the Diagram in your campaign, individ-
ual PCs who complete goals for them may be able to
gain them as a patron, and in so doing, gain their patron
benefit. However, the Diagram’s motivations might not
always align with those of everyone in the party.
```

```
Patron Goals
For PCs who are willing to risk association, the Diagram
might offer goals like the following:
Trust the Diagram. Complete a task of sabotage or
subterfuge given to you by a member of the Diagram.
You’re unlikely to fully understand why you need to
complete this task, but it’s important that you trust it
serves the needs of the Diagram.
Patron Benefit: The Diagram
In addition to offering amenities, the Diagram has a
vast network of spies and assassins. Once per week,
if you name a target that aligns with the Diagram’s
interests (as determined by the GM), the Diagram will
eliminate them for you. But if you make requests that
don’t align with the Diagram, you can quickly find
yourself on the wrong side of its plans.
```

## Ghostbloods

```
A powerful but highly secretive organization, the
Ghostbloods were formed to protect the world of
Scadrial at all costs. They’ve since spread to many
planets throughout the cosmere, Roshar included.
The Rosharan branch of the Ghostbloods has one
particular focus: to carry vast quantities of Stormlight
offworld and into the hands of their leader, Thaidakar.
He seeks the secrets of Stormlight as a source of
freedom and power.
Rosharan Ghostbloods serve Scadrial and
Thaidakar in several ways. First, the Ghostbloods
seek control of the Oathgates, and they search for
perfect gemstones they can use to transport Stormlight
through Shadesmar. Second, they’re obsessed with
finding Ba-Ado-Mishram. Third, they seek to recruit
the Unmade Sja-anat and bond the spren she has
Enlightened. Finally, they seek to imprison Heralds,
hoping to eliminate potential adversaries and gain
information to help Thaidakar.
```

```
Assassinations of Leaders
One of Taravangian’s most significant actions was the
assassination of numerous world leaders. He obtained
Szeth’s Oathstone and ordered him to kill important
leaders. Among many others, these murders included
two Azish Primes, King Hanavanar of Jah Keved, and
several Veden highprinces, creating a succession crisis
and triggering a Veden civil war.
Taravangian also sought Dalinar Kholin’s death, as
Dalinar’s attempts to unite the highprinces threatened
Taravangian’s ability to rule Roshar. However, Szeth
was routed by Kaladin Stormblessed before he could
finish the job.
```

```
Rule of Jah Keved
Taravangian’s machinations put him in a position to
claim the throne of Jah Keved. He posed as a kindly
foreign king hoping to aid Jah Keved in the wake of
its deadly civil war, while concealing his own role in
fomenting that conflict. The Veden highprince Valam
who emerged as king was on his deathbed by the time
he realized Taravangian’s neutrality was feigned. His
last act was to name Taravangian as his successor.
```

```
Graves and Elhokar
One notable repercussion of the Diagram began with
Graves, an Alethi Shardbearer. According to his
interpretation of Taravangian’s writings, the Diagram
needed to ally themselves with Dalinar Kholin—but to
do that, they would need to assassinate King Elhokar.
Though Graves ultimately died to the Fused, he
recruited Moash, a member of Bridge Four, to the
cause. He also tried to recruit Kaladin, but Kaladin
saved Elhokar instead.
```

```
Betrayal of the Coalition
After the Everstorm marked the beginning of the True
Desolation, Taravangian joined Dalinar’s coalition
in Urithiru. He had reevaluated the Diagram and
determined that he could unite Roshar by replacing
Dalinar as the coalition’s leader.
He discovered three secrets: Roshar was originally
inhabited only by the singers, King Elhokar had sworn
allegiance to Dalinar as highking, and Dalinar’s visions
involved talking with Odium. Taravangian released
a twisted version of these facts to the public, casting
Dalinar as a man who was hungry for the throne and
fraternizing with the enemy. The revelation also called
the coalition’s goals into question, as the humans
seemed to be invaders bent on invading again. With
this, Dalinar’s coalition temporarily crumbled, though
it reunited after the Battle of Thaylen Field.
```

**140** Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations

```
These disparate goals—some reasonable, others
mysterious in their motivation—have led the Scadrian
Ghostbloods to view the Rosharan branch as chaotic,
but few can deny that the Ghostbloods have significantly
impacted Roshar’s current events.
```

```
Structure
Deeply loyal, Ghostbloods trust their own. Their strict
hierarchy reinforces this, and Ghostbloods don’t keep
secrets from their fellow members. Those who break
ties with the group may be hunted, and those who share
information outside of the group are assassinated.
Each Ghostblood has a tattoo somewhere on their
body in the shape of three overlapping diamonds.
```

```
Cosmere Travelers
Many Ghostbloods are worldhoppers, and thus carry
with them useful things from other worlds in the
cosmere, such as Aviar (birds from First of the Sun),
seons (spren-like beings from Sel), and white sand
(a material from Taldain that can detect the presence
of Investiture).
```

```
Actions on Roshar
The Ghostbloods have meddled in many events on
Roshar, some more successfully than others. Some
highlights include the following:
Bonding Corrupted Spren. The Ghostbloods seek
“Enlightened” spren from the Unmade Sja-anat.
Targeting Jasnah. For reasons unknown to Jasnah
Kholin, the Ghostbloods have tried to assassinate
her several times.
Thwarting the Sons of Honor. Ghostbloods have
clashed with this rival society. They currently have
highprinces Thanadal and Vamah—who are both
leaders of the Sons of Honor—in their sights.
```

```
Notable Members
Though most Ghostbloods work across the cosmere or
on other worlds, some members are based on Roshar.
Thaidakar
Thaidakar—the Lord of Scars—leads the Ghostbloods
from the shadows. As a Cognitive Shadow tied to
Scadrial, Thaidakar can’t leave his planet via Shadesmar
like living worldhoppers can, so he relies heavily on the
Ghostbloods to enact his cunning long-term plans.
His primary goal is to prepare Scadrial for potential
threats throughout the cosmere. On Roshar, his Ghost-
bloods search for ways for him to leave the Scadrian
subastral, as well as ways to avoid the maladies of the
```

```
“Are you the
hunter, or are you
the quarry?”
—Iyatil
```

```
mind observed in other Cognitive Shadows (like the
Fused and Heralds).
Thaidakar and Hoid (introduced in the upcoming
“Worldsingers” entry) are rather antagonistic to each
other, as Hoid considers him dangerous and would
prefer he didn’t meddle with Roshar.
Iyatil
Iyatil is Master Thaidakar’s pupil and Mraize’s master.
Though she was born in Silverlight, she’s of Southern
Scadrian heritage and always wears a lacquered wood
mask that marks her as a member of a Scadrian tribe.
```

ESTHER SCHRADER

Mraize
The man whom Shallan knows by the title of
Mraize—whose real name is Betd—is a worldhopper
from Thaylenah and a high-ranking member of the
Ghostbloods. As Shallan’s direct mentor, he gives
Shallan her assignments for the Ghostbloods.

Shallan
Shallan met and worked with the Ghostbloods under
her persona of Veil. Manipulating her way into a
meeting, she impressed Mraize, and he began giving
her increasingly important assignments. When Mraize
eventually discovered her true identity, he used it
to lure her into further work with the Ghostbloods.
Under Mraize’s direction, Shallan infiltrated Meridas
Amaram’s manor, investigated the Herald Taln while
he was detained by Dalinar, communicated with Sja-
anat, and more.

```
Kabsal
Kabsal was a Ghostblood who went undercover as an
ardent in the Palanaeum. He feigned romantic interest
in Shallan to get close to Jasnah Kholin, then tried to
assassinate Jasnah via poisoned bread. His attempt
ultimately failed, and through Jasnah’s Soulcasting,
he accidentally poisoned himself and died.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using the Ghostbloods in your campaign,
individual PCs who complete goals for them may be
able to gain them as a patron, and in so doing, gain
their patron benefit. Though the Ghostbloods’ motiva-
tions may not always align with other party members,
they’re no strangers to agents with divided loyalties.
```

```
Patron Goals
For PCs who are willing to risk association, the
Ghostbloods might offer goals like the following:
Find a Perfect Gemstone. Locate and obtain a gem-
stone cut so well that it leaks negligible Stormlight,
then deliver it to the Ghostbloods.
Patron Benefit: Ghostbloods
The Ghostbloods can provide access to very discreet
and secretive amenities. Additionally, they can acquire
exotic items from places in the cosmere beyond Roshar.
At the GM’s discretion, the Ghostbloods can give or
loan you an item from another world, such as:
```

◆ (^) A black sand that turns white when exposed to
Investiture.
◆ (^) A strange cube that allows instantaneous
communication with the Ghostbloods or other people
with access to them.
◆ (^) Spores that explode into a tangle of vines when
exposed to water, dealing 2d8 impact damage to
everything within 10 feet and creating difficult
terrain in that area.
◆ (^) Items from other books in the Cosmere RPG
(at the GM’s discretion).
You can exchange this item for a new one when
you next meet with your Ghostblood handler.
The Ghostbloods can’t provide items that are
restricted to characters above your tier.

more people than
it saves.”_

### Skybreakers

The Skybreakers are the only order of the Knights
Radiant that didn’t abandon their oaths on the Day
of Recreance—and the only order that has sided with
the Voidbringers during the True Desolation. Though
their leader, the Herald Nale, morally opposes Odium,
he recognizes the singers’ lawful claim to Roshar. He
thus directs his Skybreakers to do the same, assisting
Odium’s military efforts when they involve reclaiming
land from humans.
The Skybreakers can use the surges of Gravitation
and Division, making them dangerous combatants.
Meanwhile, their training imparts a deep understanding
of legal codes and techniques to recognize guilt
or deceit.
The “Skybreaker” entry in chapter 8 presents stat
blocks for Skybreaker NPCs in your game.

The Ancient Skybreakers

Before the Recreance, the Skybreakers followed a
strong moral code that drove them to oppose anarchy
and tyranny. They relied on law and legal structures to
fight for justice, even going so far as to ensure the other
orders of Radiants didn’t misuse their powers. To them,
law was a higher ideal to follow, something to strive for
despite its potential imperfections.
Uniquely, the Skybreakers acted as a military force
that policed the other Radiants, ensuring none would
become tyrants acting above the law. This created some
conflict with other orders, especially the Dustbringers
(whom the Skybreakers considered to skirt the line of
morality) and the Windrunners (who often disregarded
the law to do what they considered right).

After the Recreance

After the Day of Recreance, the Skybreakers went into
hiding, operating out of a fortress on the northern edge
of the Purelake in Marabethia. Here, potential Radiants
faced exacting tests, and Nale only granted spren bonds
to those he deemed worthy.
During the Era of Solitude, Ishar told Nale that if the
other orders returned, it would bring about the return
of the Voidbringers—so prospective Radiants must
either be killed or recruited into the Skybreakers. Thus
began Nale’s crusade to stop others from bonding spren,
preventing the return of the Knights Radiant.

```
Modern Era
Nale began to influence the minds of new Skybreakers
he recruited, and over the years, the order has become
merciless and unyielding. Nale has abandoned his
empathy, and he drives the Skybreakers to enforce
uncompromising punishments to suit their needs.
Where the order was once loyal to the ideal of the law,
they now feel no guilt in exploiting loopholes in the
very codes they swear to follow.
As the Voidbringers returned, Nale’s crusade drew
near its end. In one key moment, Nale traveled to
Yeddaw, a city in Tashikk, where the young Edgedancer
Lift stopped him from killing a Truthwatcher who
ran a local orphanage. Lift convinced him the True
Desolation had come, and Nale wept and fled Yeddaw.
```

```
The Truth of the Recreance
After this truth was revealed, Nale left the Skybreakers
for some time, grappling with the Everstorm’s
arrival and seeking Ishar’s guidance. He returned
to the Skybreakers and told them the origins of the
Desolations. There, he declared his intention to side
with the singers who had lawful claim over Roshar as
its original inhabitants.
```

```
Squires and Masters
The Ideal of Justice, taken by Skybreaker squires, is
an oath to seek and administer justice. The Ideal of
Dedication—the last Ideal reached for most Skybreak-
ers—is taken after they bond a highspren; in this Ideal,
they dedicate themselves to a greater truth like a person
or a code of conduct. Some Skybreakers take the Ideal
of Crusade, pledging themselves to a specific personal
quest; once that’s completed to the satisfaction of their
spren, they’re elevated to the level of master and can
take on squires.
The Skybreakers train their squires with unique
training methods that emphasize critical thinking. In
one such method, Szeth and other candidates were told
of an outbreak of convicts, then instructed to find the
guilty and execute them. While many obeyed, Szeth
questioned the convicts and determined that the prison
was cruelly run, the convicts were starving, and their
wardens were strict and harsh. Szeth instead killed the
prison administrator, administering a more righteous
justice. For doing so, he was chosen as a squire by Ki,
a master Skybreaker.
```

```
Chapter 5: Allies and Organizations 143
```

```
Nale
Nale is a Skybreaker himself and the only Herald
known to join his own order. Once an empathetic,
compassionate soul, the torture he endured on
Braize rid him of that empathy. His highspren, 121,
encourages literal and inflexible interpretations of
the law, which certainly hasn’t helped temper Nale’s
callousness. At times, Nale is horrified at who he
has become—but those moments are fleeting before
trauma retakes him.
```

```
Szeth
Nale inducted Szeth into the Skybreakers and assigned
him a highspren named 12124. Szeth trained under
Ki, swearing the Second Ideal. When Nale decided to
join the singers, Szeth left Nale’s Skybreakers, deciding
instead to serve Dalinar Kholin. (See the “Szeth”
section earlier in this chapter for more information.)
Helaran
Helaran Davar, Shallan Davar’s oldest brother, joined
the Skybreakers. He intended to kill Highlord Meridas
Amaram, but Kaladin killed Helaran before he could
complete the job.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using the Skybreakers in your campaign,
individual PCs who complete goals for them may be
able to gain them as a patron, and in so doing, gain their
patron benefit. While the Skybreakers’ motivations may
not always align with everyone in the party, they’ll work
with enemies if the law requires.
```

```
Patron Goals
For PCs who are willing to risk association, the
Skybreakers might offer goals like the following:
Enact Justice. Apprehend a criminal who has broken
local laws.
Help the Singers. Work alongside awakened parshmen
to rescue singers who have been captured by slavers.
```
