```
Notable Sons of Honor
The Sons of Honor are generally ruthless, caring little
for the death of innocents if it brings them closer to their
goals. The following individuals are notable members.
```

```
Amaram
Meridas Amaram’s primary goal was to lure the
Heralds back to Roshar by unleashing the Voidbringers.
A religious extremist, he was willing to go to terrible
lengths to restore the Vorin church. He was also self-
obsessed and saw himself as the perfect Alethi lighteyes,
making him susceptible to manipulation by Odium.
This ultimately resulted in his death after he swallowed
the power of an Unmade (see “Servant of Yelig-Nar”
in chapter 8).
```

```
Patron Benefit: Skybreakers
In addition to offering amenities (usually those of
the local law enforcement), the order can dispatch
a Skybreaker to fly your group around Roshar if
you can contact them and persuade them that your
mission aligns with their Ideals. This Skybreaker won’t
knowingly fly you into any kind of danger or enemy
territory that would require Gravitation tests to navigate.
The amount of time it takes for them to arrive and help
you is at the GM’s discretion based on your current
circumstances. The Skybreaker Flight Frequency table
lists how often you can call for this help, depending on
your tier.

Sons of Honor
The Sons of Honor is a society that works to restore
the dominion of the Vorin church, though its goals and
methods aren’t aligned with the church’s teachings.
The organization is led by Restares, who is secretly the
Herald Kalak. The Sons of Honor seek to bring about
the return of the Voidbringers, in hopes the Heralds will
also return—and in so doing, reassert Vorin dominance
and restore the power that the church claimed during
the Hierocracy.
Gavilar Kholin and Meridas Amaram were both
prominent members of the Sons of Honor. As Gavilar
rose quickly through the ranks and brought in many
new recruits, he developed his own goal: to amass
godlike power. He and Restares began collaborating in
secret until Gavilar was assassinated.
Following Gavilar’s death, the organization and
its leadership shifted. Amaram rose to a position of
leadership, where he focused on researching the listeners
and Voidbringers and searching for Urithiru.
After Amaram’s death during the Battle of Thaylen
Field, the Sons of Honor tried to unite under Ialai
Sadeas, but they remain vulnerable to attack from their
most immediate rivals, the Ghostbloods.

Patron Benefit: Sons of Honor
In addition to offering amenities, the Sons of Honor are
widely connected. When you request assistance from
the Sons of Honor, they can provide you with guards
or other assistance for missions that align with their
interests. These guards follow the rules for companions
of your tier (see “Companions” in chapter 8 of the
Stormlight Handbook ) and stay with you until the stated
mission is complete.

Worldsingers
Founded by the worldhopper Hoid, the Worldsingers are
a group of storytellers who spread knowledge and bring
peace through understanding. They traverse Roshar to
learn about other peoples and cultures, then share that
information with others.
A Worldsinger’s knowledge is extensive, covering
topics such as architecture, demographics, geography,
local traditions, peoples, religion, and trade. They ask
precise questions and seek precise answers to glean
that knowledge—but when they disperse it, they turn
to stories and allegories to disseminate knowledge
and inspire peace.
```

```
Notable Worldsingers
Hoid is the founder of the Worldsingers, and Sigzil is his
most prominent apprentice.
```

```
Hoid
Hoid holds the self-appointed rank of Master
Worldsinger. He has long used sand, smoke, and his
Trailman’s flute to captivate audiences with his stories.
Now, after bonding the Cryptic called Design, he has
added Lightweaving to his repertoire.
However, Hoid is far more than a storyteller—or at
least, the tale he tells is more expansive than the story
of any single world. A traveler across the cosmere, Hoid
was present at the Shattering of Adonalsium but refused
to take up the power of a Shard. He has spent millennia
as a worldhopper, guided by Fortune to provide counsel
to those who need it.
Just as Hoid gathers stories, he collects Invested
Arts. Surgebinding, Allomancy, and Awakening are just
some of the magic systems he has gained in his travels.
Hoid has taken a particular interest in Roshar,
from his role as the King’s Wit to his courting of
Queen Jasnah. Though many dismiss him as a
frivolous misanthrope, he’s a brilliant and calculating
individual. His long-term motives are difficult
to discern, but he clearly opposes the threat that
Odium poses to the cosmere.
```

```
Gavilar
Gavilar Kholin was an influential member who greatly
expanded the ranks of the Sons of Honor, including
bringing in Amaram. Gavilar’s plan to bring back
the Void bringers ended when he was assassinated by
the listeners.
Gavilar also pursued dangerous research, seeking
the power to kill a god. This led him to discover anti-
Light, which could be used as a deadly weapon against
Invested creatures.
```

```
Ialai
Ialai Sadeas is a calculating political mastermind
well-versed in intrigue. During the War of Reckoning,
she managed her princedom’s network of spies and
assassins. When her husband was murdered, she
believed Dalinar was responsible and began working
with the Sons of Honor in an attempt to expose and
overthrow him. After Odium took control of House
Sadeas’s soldiers at the Battle of Thaylen Field, she left
Urithiru and returned to the warcamps to continue
her schemes.
Restares
The Herald Kalak, operating under the name Restares,
is the only surviving leader of the Sons of Honor. He
and the Herald Nale encouraged Gavilar’s work on
transporting spheres across long distances, presumably
to find a way out of the Rosharan system. Kalak is aware
of and concerned about the deteriorating minds of
the Heralds.
Though he has moved his base of operations to
Shadesmar, he hasn’t given up his obsession with
leaving the Rosharan system and the cycle of Deso-
lations behind.
```

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using the Sons of Honor in your campaign,
individual PCs who complete goals for them may be
able to gain them as a patron, and in so doing, gain their
patron benefit. Though the Sons of Honor’s motivations
may not always align with everyone in the party, some of
their missions might intrigue heroic characters.
```

```
Patron Goals
For PCs who are willing to risk association, the Sons
of Honor might offer goals like the following:
Capture the Void. Capture a Voidspren in a gemstone
and deliver it to the Sons of Honor.
Investigate the Ghostbloods. Stop an agent whom the
Sons of Honor believe to be a Ghostblood assassin.

Sigzil
Sigzil is an Azish member of Bridge Four, a companylord
of the Order of Windrunners, and a full Worldsinger—
though he took quite the path to get there. In Azir,
he found himself in trouble after failing his exams to
become a public servant. Hoid rescued him and took
him on as an apprentice, though the two sometimes
clashed, as Sigzil could be judgmental and thoughtless.
After Sigzil and Hoid were separated, Sigzil eventually
became a bridgeman.
For a while, he hid his affiliation with the
World singers, but he eventually began to tell the
other bridgemen about far-off lands and peoples, such
as Sesemalex Dar and the Emuli. Hoid finally located
him again and promoted Sigzil to a full Worldsinger.
Like other members of Bridge Four, Sigzil became
a Windrunner squire and fought for the coalition during
the Battle of Thaylen Field. Soon after, he bonded the
honorspren Vienta. With his scholar’s mind and tactical
acumen, he’s viewed as a leader and role model by the
other Windrunners.

```
Goals and Rewards
If you’re using the Worldsingers in your campaign,
individual PCs who complete goals for them may be
able to gain them as a patron, and in so doing, gain
their patron benefit.
```

Patron Goals
The Worldsingers might offer goals like the following:
**Observe Traditions.** Participate in a festival or cultural
observance in another nation, then write a treatise on
your experiences.
**Influence a Leader.** The citylord of an Alethi settle-
ment has held out against Odium’s forces, but certain
destruction is coming. Tell him a story that persuades
him to retreat with his citizens, preventing needless
bloodshed.
Patron Benefit: Worldsingers
In addition to offering amenities, the Worldsingers
can put in a good word for you with many cultures
that would normally be untrusting of outsiders, and
help you make connections despite not speaking any
local languages. When a Worldsinger does so, you can
be given a chance in an unfamiliar culture when you
wouldn’t otherwise, and you can obtain an interpreter
to help you get around. At the GM’s discretion, this
can include the cultures of worlds beyond Roshar.

Emotion and Plot
Setting and narrative are deeply intertwined in the
cosmere. The barren crem-layered Shattered Plains,
the mysterious obsidian expanse of Shadesmar, the
majestic spire of Urithiru towering above Roshar—each
memorable location serves the narrative happening
within it. To create a strong and narratively cohesive
campaign, consider how the physical setting of a
campaign works in tandem with the story arcs to
reinforce themes and events.
The locations in the Stormlight Archive serve two
functions: They reinforce emotion , and they unfold plot.
Each setting not only augments the storyline, but it
holds secrets or plot beats for characters to investigate
and engage with.
Reinforcing Emotion
Consider the progression present in the novels: The
Shattered Plains are empty of civilization aside from
two enemies—the listeners and Alethi—and empty
of motivation aside from war and greed. Here, the
wide-open plateaus leave soldiers exposed on all sides.
This strengthens Kaladin’s early feelings of isolation,
despair, lack of direction, and vulnerability. The chasms
enclose and separate Kaladin and Bridge Four from
the exploitative highprinces and lighteyes, providing
Bridge Four a home—but the chasms are also filled with
chasmfiends and other dangers, ensuring this home is
never truly safe.
```

```
Reinforcing Plot
In addition to sparking emotions, the simple setting of
the Shattered Plains is wrought with questions: What
lies at the center? Why are the plateaus in a symmetrical
pattern? What are the lights in the center plateau? Some
of these answers are only revealed when the story moves
forward through climactic scenes. The protagonists
eventually learn that Stormseat and the Oathgate lie at
the center, then the story advances to Urithiru—a new
setting and a new stage in the story.
Repeating the Cycle
And so the cycle repeats itself. Urithiru as a setting
reinforces emotions: Feelings of confusion, loss,
uncertainty, and wonder are compounded by the
strange architecture, empty halls, inoperative systems,
intriguing murals, marvelous fabrials, and bewildering
height. Gaining Urithiru feels like a tentative win—

oshar is a diverse world with countless
locations you can use as a backdrop for story
arcs or entire campaigns. This chapter presents
five iconic locations from the Stormlight Archive. In
settings like these, characters might boldly change
the fate of Roshar—or they might play a subtler role
in saving ordinary people, uncovering astonishing
secrets, or simply preparing for the arrival of influential
Radiants.
```

```
Using These Locations
This chapter describes the following locations around
Roshar and presents adventure hooks to inspire new
stories on Roshar:
Occupied Alethkar. Under the hostile rule of Odium’s
forces, Alethkar is a mere shadow of what it once was.
Danger lurks overhead as the Fused and Regals survey
their new domain and enslave the human masses who
previously enslaved their kind.
Rall Elorim. Water flows from an ethereal mountain
fount, cascading over the entrance to a grand Iriali city.
Odium’s forces have found a home here, though it’s
not as tranquil as it appears.
Shattered Plains. Plateaus divided by perilous chasms
form a vast battleground where Alethi troops and
listeners compete to claim the gemhearts of pupating
chasmfiends.
Urithiru. A rediscovered city with a powerful spren
has become the staging ground for the Coalition of
Monarchs and others who defy Odium. Tucked away
in the mountains of central Roshar, this tower contains
vast levels, and each hides ancient secrets.
Warcamps. Bordering the Shattered Plains, the
warcamps are temporary cities ruled by Alethi
highprinces. Although they exist to host armies,
the warcamps include more than just barracks.
```

```
Chapter 6: Points of Interest 149
```

MARIE SEEBERGER

Status of occupied

Alethkar in 1175.

```
the city holds great potential, as long as they can get the
systems working—and yet it is full of untold mysteries
and dangers. Since Urithiru can’t function as a home for
the refugees right away, this enhances their feelings of
instability as the Fused wreak havoc across Roshar.
Urithiru answers questions as much as it leads to
further questions. It unlocks answers about the Knights
Radiant, it leads to discovering the Oathgates, and it
provides a place for the protagonists to operate out of
and research Odium, the Voidbringers, and Urithiru.
When the characters are pushed against the wall with
their current allies and knowledge, they transition to a
new setting once again—this time, Shadesmar. There,
they expand their understanding of the Cognitive
Realm and of spren, and they gain new allies in young
honorspren.
Over and over, the cycle continues. The more the
characters encounter the otherworldly and magical,
the more magical locations they’re then led to, pushing
them further and further into the mysteries. Mean-
while, the more “grounded” regions continue to evolve
over time to reinforce the stakes of the campaign; for
example, Alethkar descends into a warzone ravaged by
Voidbringers and Unmade, mixing the supernatural
with the mundane to keep the characters grounded
in the tragedy. Fighting Voidbringers in Shadesmar
is one thing—saving your own countryfolk from the
manipulations of an Unmade is something else entirely,
something far more personal.
```

```
Using Locations
When choosing where to set a campaign or adventure, it
helps to determine the desired themes, story beats, and
progression of your narrative. Combat-driven campaigns
could start near the Shattered Plains, engaging in the
war between Alethkar and the listeners, while scholarly
characters may encounter Shadesmar much earlier than
other stories would call for. Campaigns can span the
entire continent and other realms to expose characters
to many different cultures, religions, ways of thinking,
and knowledge; on the other hand, staying near
Alethkar and playing out the Voidbringers’ siege makes
Alethkar’s occupation more focused and personal.
Your adventures should never be constricted by the
plot and setting progression in the novels. A story about
the Knights Radiant can be told anywhere, from the
Shattered Plains to the streets of Tukar. For example,
imagine Tukari Radiants discovering their god-priest is a
Herald; in this case, the plot might revolve around saving
Radiant spren from his cruel experiments. Roshar offers
boundless places to tell stories that suit your campaign—
the following sections simply provide a starting point.
```

```
Occupied Alethkar
For centuries, Alethkar was known as the nation
of warriors. But while King Elhokar Kholin and his
highprinces warred on the Shattered Plains, they
drained the nation’s wealth and soldiers, inadvertently
weakening their homeland.
When the Everstorm arrived, Odium was quick to
strike at a vulnerable Alethkar, marshaling the newly
awakened singers for a decisive capture of the Alethi
capital of Kholinar.
As the True Desolation grinds onward, the Fused
and singers have made Alethkar their own, and it now
serves as the heart of Odium’s forces.
```

```
Overview
When creating adventures in occupied Alethkar,
consider the following factors.
Government
During the siege of Kholinar, Queen Aesudan Kholin
provided no leadership to the city or nation. After the
capital fell, Alethkar—called Avendla by the Fused—
became ruled by the Nine, a group of ancient and
respected singers who are entombed in stone. Outside
the capital itself, Regals took over administration of the
cities and villages.
```

```
Inhabitants
During the occupation, Alethkar’s population remained
predominantly human, but most inhabitants were
farmers, tradespeople, citylords, and other non-
combatants who didn’t go to the Shattered Plains.
Though singers only comprised one-tenth of the
population, they claimed control of the country under
the guidance of the Fused.
Economy
At the direction of the Fused, the singers pressed the
Alethi humans into manual labor and production.
Alethkar’s economy turned to a new goal: supporting
Odium’s ar mies.
```

```
Culture
As the occupation began, the Alethi singers found
themselves forging a new place for themselves in the
world, embracing their freedom and deciding who
they would become. Some were vengeful, seeing
```

**150** Chapter 6: Points of Interest

```
ISAAC STEWART
```

```
an opportunity to redress generations of slavery at
human hands. Others focused on emulating the Fused
and embracing their newly revealed heritage.
Meanwhile, the Fused saw humanity as vermin to be
exterminated, corralled, or channeled to Odium’s ends.
And for the Alethi humans, their lives became defined
by their lack of control, a pervading sense of fear, and—
in some—an abiding guilt for the atrocities they and
their ancestors visited on the singers.
```

```
Kholinar
Located in the Kholin princedom, the capital city of
Kholinar was built on the site of one of the Dawncities.
During the Siege
Immediately after the Everstorm, Odium’s forces began
to harry Kholinar. They sent refugees to overburden
the city, and they used secretspren and Fused to
disrupt the city’s ability to communicate with its allies.
These secretspren could also track some forms of
Surgebinding, including the surge of Gravitation.
The wall guard, an honorable and well-organized
fighting force led by the mysterious Highmarshal Azure,
held for some time, but the city behind them plunged
into chaos due to the presence of three Unmade.
The ardentia and populace were influenced by the
Unmade Ashertmarn as well as the Cult of Moments,
a group who worships spren and preaches the words of
Odium. Spren in the city were corrupted by Sja-anat,
the same Unmade who altered Renarin Kholin’s
spren Glys. A third Unmade, Yelig-nar, bonded with
Queen Aesudan.
Eventually, Odium’s forces mounted a massive
assault and overtook the city. King Elhokar was killed
on a rescue mission and the walls were broken. In the
aftermath, Queen Aesudan was consumed and Jezrien,
the king of Heralds, was killed.
```

```
After the Siege
Under the Fused’s rulership, Kholinar’s singers put the
humans to work rebuilding the city. However, the most
awesome feats of construction were completed by the
Fused known as the Altered Ones. 
Many new brands of Fused took up residence in
Kholinar, such as Masked Ones (who can change their
appearance) and Focused Ones (who can transform into
incredibly strong and dense warrior forms).
Singers and humans alike learned to step carefully
in Kholinar, because at any time, a Heavenly One
could be watching from above or a Masked One could
be disguised as a neighbor. Under the Fused, Kholinar
became a city of harsh realities: singers must assimilate
and humans must submit.
```

```
The Fused encouraged the singers in Kholinar
to explore the ancient ways of their people—their art,
food, music, and more—and to abandon everything
Alethi that they had absorbed... everything except war.
After each storm, newly blessed Regals gathered in
the former dueling arena—now used to train under
capricious and volatile Fused—in preparation for
rotations to the various fronts.
```

```
Important Locations
Occupied Alethkar includes areas devoted to the Fused,
pockets of resistance, and opportunities for growth
and change.
Karanak
Located on a delta in the Bethab princedom, Karanak is
one of the last bastions of coalition control in Alethkar.
Bitterly contested due to its strategic importance
as a major port, Karanak is threatened by a violent
singer who calls himself “Brightlord” Hathalash. This
ambitious Regal strives to impress the Fused with
his passion, and he frequently clashes with Karanak's
besieged defenders.
```

```
Rashir
Though a key center for trade in the Sebarial
princedom, Rashir lies far from constant Fused
influence. The local singers are given latitude in
administration, so the city is governed by an elected
council of singers and humans.
However, rumors multiply regarding dark, shadowy
monsters menacing nearby settlements. In truth, these
creatures are Midnight Essence (described in chapter 8)
spawned by Re-Shephir after she fled Urithiru.
Revolar
After the capture of Kholinar, Revolar faded
into obscurity and lawlessness, with various rival
organizations seizing sections of the city. Some groups,
such as the overbearing Regents of Vamah, are headed
by power-seeking lighteyes. Others, such as the
anti-authoritarian Parshenati—“those who destroy”—
are run by singers seeking to redefine the derogatory
name given to their listener cousins.
The few Fused in Revolar don’t interfere as long as
the city continues sending food and materials to the
war effort.

Rall Elorim
Rall Elorim, the City of Shadows, is the capital of Iri.
A vast overhang of natural stone shelters it, creating a
safe haven from the highstorms—and shrouding much
of the city in darkness. Freshwater cascades from the
mountainous overhang, forming the Stormfalls, which
collect in a reservoir that surrounds the city’s Oathgate.
The shelter and the spray create a rich environment
for plant life, leaving the city draped in vines and slick
with algae.
```

```
Overview
When creating adventures in Rall Elorim, consider the
following factors.
Inhabitants
During the True Desolation, the Iriali humans of
Rall Elorim made peace with the singers and Odium’s
forces. Many humans welcomed the Iriali singers, and
some even celebrated the experiences they could offer
the One, but tension still simmers beneath the surface.
While the singers are acknowledged as stewards of the
land, many object to Odium’s rule. A secret resistance
of humans and singers fights the Fused who have arrived
to govern the city.
```

```
Culture
As one of the Dawncities, Rall Elorim is truly ancient.
It changed hands many times during the Desolations,
giving the city uniquely varied architecture tracing
back to both humans and singers. The Iriali have since
built myriad shrines and temples to celebrate the One.
Most striking are the thousands of prayer statues along
every street and canal, each celebrating a unique facet
of human (or even singer) experience.
Government
The rulers of Iri preside from the palace in Rall Elorim.
Before the Everstorm, the Iri Triumvirate consisted
of two kings and a queen. As part of their peace with
Odium’s forces, the monarchs were joined by one Regal
singer from Iri and two Fused, forming a ruling council.
These singers also hold royal titles, but to maintain
existing relationships, the human monarchs handle
foreign relations.
Prominent among the monarchs is Imalei, a femalen
envoyform singer, who serves as public speaker and
go-between for the Fused. During her transition to a
form of power, Imalei’s Voidspren recognized the truth
of her gemheart and freed her of her malen slaveform.
Imalei now serves the Fused fervently, building a
new experience for the One.

The Vaults
A maze of tunnels and caves leads beyond the
Dirgehollow district, hosting hundreds of tombs and
mausoleums dating back to the earliest settlement of
the city. Though a haven for historians, the tunnels are
difficult to navigate and cave-ins are common.

vault of treasured artifacts. Though Pailiah began her
archiving to honor the people and places she has known
during her immortal life, her passion has fallen to

```

```
The Trail of Stars
Those who learn of the migrations of the Iriali through
the cosmere soon question the “where,” “when,” and
“how.” With a wry smile, an Iriali might suggest their
inquisitive friend visit a local cobbler and seek the
Trail of Stars.
The Trail is a carefully kept oral tradition spoken
among many of Rall Elorim’s shoemakers. Its countless
stories teach the importance of taking the correct steps
along your unique life’s journey, keeping vigilant for
signs along the path, and (of course) finding the proper
footwear for the next leg of the Trail. Elements of the
Trail’s eclectic tales have become embedded throughout
the architecture of the city for those who know where to
look. Out-of-place prayer statues, glyphs with strange
flourishes, and arches adorned in peculiar metals—
anything could be a “sign” placed by a Trail adherent
hoping to inspire a traveler to find their way.
Feverstone Road
Shaped during the Desolations by the Knights Radiant,
Feverstone Road once cut a clean pass through the
mountains from Rall Elorim to Feverstone Keep. Since
the Recreance, Feverstone Road has gradually fallen to
ruin, lost to memory and long buried by crem.
Nevertheless, Iriali archaeologists argue over cryptic
historical references to a “betrayer’s path” beginning
somewhere in Rall Elorim. Daring treasure hunters
sometimes launch expeditions to map the road, chasing
rumors of buried Shards. However, many claim the
pursuit is foolish, and some stories suggest that any
Shards are kept in the clutches of jealous deathspren.

Another councillor, a malen Deepest One named
Dymab, has made a mission of eliminating the

with her own agenda.

Important Locations

Visitors to Rall Elorim can find the following sites of
historical and cultural significance.

The Stormfalls
Climbing the crest of the Stormfalls is notoriously
dangerous, especially with the unpredictable storm
surges. However, successful climbers are rewarded
with groves of rare plants that can be refined into
expensive spices and medicines. Weary tidereaders
and Truthwatchers have been known to seek peaceful
meditation at the brink of the roaring waterfalls.

Elorim Reservoir
At the heart of the city, a perfectly circular reservoir
collects water from the Stormfalls, ready for distribution
to the region’s canals. The spray attracts shimmering
vaporspren who glide about the pool on gossamer wings.
A stone bridge runs to the reservoir’s center, where a
weathered temple honors the One. This central platform
is the site of Rall Elorim’s Oathgate, and the temple is its
control building.
In the first days of the Weeping, when rainbows spill
across the Stormfalls most brightly, city dwellers take
rafts onto the reservoir to celebrate their Vaporlight
Festival. They sing, dance together, and don elaborate
vaporspren costumes in myriad colors. However, many
Iriali worry this festival will become a flashpoint for
tension between the Fused and the resistance.

The Dirgehollow
At the base of the overhanging mountain where the
streets are in near-constant darkness, the lawless
district known as the Dirgehollow collects the poor and
downtrodden. Here, the anti-Fused resistance enjoys
relatively free rein.
The district earns its name and reputation from
countless stories of hauntings and terrible visions.
Enigmatic shadowspren, wailing songs, and wandering
figures all feature in these tales. Many beggars and
urchins are afraid to stay too long on the streets of the
Hollow, but they often have little choice.
The stories reflect a tragic truth: The crypts beneath
the Dirgehollow host the gemhearts of shadowform
singers created by Ba-Ado-Mishram during the False
Desolation. Trapped between the Cognitive and
Physical Realms, these incorporeal singers have suffered
imprisonment for millennia.

Shattered Plains
The Shattered Plains are a blasted land south of the
Unclaimed Hills. The plains themselves are split by deep
chasms, forming arid plateaus that face exceptionally
dangerous high storms. These chasms break the terrain
into a symmetrical pattern visible only from far above,
radiating from a ruined city. The pattern seems the
remnant of a great catastrophe, as if something struck
the center of the plains.
```

```
Overview
When creating adventures in the Shattered Plains,
consider the following factors.
Inhabitants
The longest continuous inhabitants of the Shattered
Plains are the listeners. These singers turned away from
Odium and the Fused during the False Desolation.
```

```
Culture
For generations, the listeners kept to themselves,
unnoticed by the surrounding human nations. In
preparation for the War of Reckoning, the listeners
concentrated their people in the ruins of Narak, while
the Alethi established warcamps in the west (discussed
in the upcoming “Warcamps” section). The Shattered
Plains have since become little more than a battlefield.
Economy
Travelers on the Shattered Plains are ever wary of
chasmfiends: enormous greatshells who prowl the
chasms to feed and fight. Chasmfiend gemhearts,
usually harvested from their dormant chrysalises, have
become the driving economy of the region for both
listeners and the Alethi. While the listeners sing with
the gemhearts to stimulate crop growth in Narak, the
Alethi use them to Soulcast grain to feed their armies.
The great value of these gemhearts has driven the
Alethi highprinces to treat their war as a competition for
gemhearts, rather than a quest for vengeance.
```

```
Important Locations
A traveler might come across the following locations
while marching across the Shattered Plains.
```

```
Narak
In the center of the Shattered Plains lies the ancient
city once known as Stormseat, the capital of the Silver
Kingdom of Natanatan. At its height, Stormseat’s
strategic and economic importance was anchored
by the Oathgate connecting it to Urithiru. However,
```

```
the shattering of the region left the once-powerful
city in ruins, split across the broken plateaus. Gradually,
humans lost all knowledge of the location of Stormseat.
However, the listeners knew the location well. During
the War of Reckoning, they built atop and around
the structures that had best weathered the storms,
transforming Stormseat into the city they named Narak,
which means exile. Narak was ruled by the Five, a
council chosen to represent the known singer forms;
they governed from atop the city’s tallest central
watchtower. The listeners built new homes combining
ruins with textiles and carapace defenses, constructed
great halls for practicing art and science, and much
more, transforming Narak into a wonder of uniquely
singer culture.
At the end of the era, the listeners’ city was swept
away in the clash of Everstorm and highstorm. The
Alethi repurposed the city again as a major supply line
to Urithiru, building their stronghold on the ruins of
the listener settlement.
Deep beneath Narak lies the Shattered Plains’
greatest secret: Odium’s Perpendicularity, the pool
containing his concentrated Investiture.
Plateaus
Since chasmfiends pupate atop the barren plateaus,
leaving their gemhearts defenseless, they became major
strategic objectives during the War of Reckoning.
Warform singers were capable of leaping the chasms,
but the Alethi armies required bridges to traverse the
broken terrain. The Alethi built permanent bridges
close to the warcamps, but the chasms further east
required the use of portable bridges. Some highprinces
employed chull-drawn and fabrial bridges, but these
proved slower than dedicated bridge crews of enslaved
and imprisoned people who risked their lives deploying
bridges during battle.
The Tower—the largest plateau known to the
Alethi—stands an eight-hour march east of the
warcamps. As a favored spot for chasmfiends to pupate,
the Tower became a frequent battlefield. However, the
Alethi never defeated the listeners there, and during
the Battle of the Tower, Dalinar Kholin’s forces were
abandoned by Sadeas and left to a crushing defeat.

Adventure Hooks
You can use the following ideas to spark an adventure
set around the Shattered Plains. The parenthetical in
each title indicates when such an adventure might be set
in Roshar’s history.
```

```
Remembrance (War of Reckoning)
A soldier laments missing the Battle of the Tower after
an injury kept him at camp. He’s now looking for a
team to help him search the chasms for the remains of
his fallen squad, desperate for closure and perhaps even
a memento.
Supply Lines (True Desolation)
Fused have been destroying bridges on the trail between
Narak’s Oathgate and the remnant warcamps. Sebarial,
Highprince of Commerce, is putting together a team to
establish a safer route.
```

```
The Big One (True Desolation)
The legendary chasmfiend Old Green Eyes is the
largest, meanest beast out there, or so the tavern stories
go. An Alethi lighteyes is willing to pay handsomely for
anyone able to bring him its head. However, a singer
secretly proposes an alternative: guide Old Green Eyes
to the eastern floodplains to be with the listeners.
Other Scenes
The Shattered Plains Scenes table presents ideas for
individual scenes you can use in any campaign.
```

```
Shattered Plains Scenes
d6 Scene
1 The ground shakes beneath the footfalls of a
chasmfiend. Time is short before the beast arrives.
2 Alethi deserters cross you on the plateaus. They press
you for food, weapons, and shelter—at spearpoint
if necessary.
3 A team of Ghostblood researchers and spies are
collecting the remains of Radiants and Fused from
the chasms.
4 A listener is harvesting colorful frillblooms from the
chasm walls. Tens of rotspren swarm around him. 
5 Pinned by storm debris, a lost listener warpair cries for 
help from anyone who can hear them.
6 A Dustbringer is burning out a dangerous nest
of shellmites in the chasms, but they may soon
be overwhelmed.
```

```
Chasms
The chasms are dark, wet, and alive with diverse flora
and fauna. Their depths would attract foragers and
surgeons looking for medical supplies—but the threat
of roaming chasmfiends dissuades all but the most
desperate from taking their chances.
Highstorms also make a death trap of the chasms.
Rushing stormwaters carry debris through the narrow
channels, leaving unprepared occupants drowned,
buried, or crushed. These waters also tend to collect
battlefield remains from atop the plateaus, creating
treasure troves of weapons, armor, and even spheres at
chasm choke points. Recovering these materials during
“chasm duty” is a risky enterprise undertaken only by
enslaved people and bridgemen.
```

```
Forgotten Ruins
Lucky travelers might uncover the remains of
settlements dating back to the era of the Silver
Kingdoms, when the city of Stormseat drew visitors
from across Roshar. Some ruins have fallen into crevices
protected from the worst of the storm waters, while
others are revealed only after catastrophic storms
damage the chasm walls.
These ruins are diverse in form and function.
At the base of a pillar-like plateau to the east, crem
has buried a stone-carved membership record of the
Last Legion. Within a chasm overhang in the north,
a temple of Vedeledev long ago became a favorite place
for chasmfiends to come to die. Thanks to the natural
protective wall created by their empty shells, much of
the temple has survived.
Listener Remnants
After the Everstorm, remnants of listener culture remain
scattered throughout the Shattered Plains. To the east,
where chasms and plateaus turn to sandy floodplains,
the singer warrior Thude is building a new home for the
refugees who spurned Eshonai’s coup. These listeners
found a way to communicate with chasmfiends and now
live peacefully among them.
A separate group of “lost listeners” have maintained
a tenuous presence in the western chasms. Wary of the
Alethi but skeptical of the need for war, a keeper of
songs named Tlaxam never united his people with the
other listeners at Narak. Instead, his people travel as
nomads, seeking shelter in whatever safe hollows they
can find in the chasms. Now a newly bonded Willshaper,
Tlaxam protects his people during highstorms by
shaping stone across their tunnels.

Overview
When creating adventures in Urithiru, consider the
following factors.
```

```
Government
The Alethi kingdom in exile was ruled first by Elhokar
Kholin, and then by Jasnah after Elhokar’s murder.
Meanwhile, Dalinar and Navani rule as king and queen
of Urithiru.
Inhabitants
When operating at full capacity, Urithiru can house
around a million people. Its current Alethi occupants
take up only a third of that space.
```

```
Economy
Turinad Sebarial, Highprince of Commerce, taxes
trade goods through the ten Oathgates.
```

Urithiru

```
As the True Desolation began, the Alethi rediscovered
the once-lost city of the Knights Radiant and former
center of the ten Silver Kingdoms.
In their early occupation, Alethi forces had to
contend with isolation, lack of resources, a harsh
climate, and a creeping malevolence. This infestation
was eventually revealed as Re-Shephir, an Unmade
who Shallan Davar drove away.
Over the following year, Dalinar Kholin established
the Coalition of Monarchs while also overseeing the
growing numbers of Knights Radiant. Scholars led by
Navani Kholin worked to unravel the city’s secrets, and
the Alethi nobility plied their usual political maneuvers
under a new queen, Jasnah Kholin.
```

**uriThiru above The approaching highsTorm**

```
Library Rooms
Once hidden behind a wall in the lower levels of
Urithiru, the library rooms hold hundreds of accounts
from the lives of ancient Knights Radiant, recorded on
gemstones and locked away. These rooms are now used
as a research center focused on uncovering the secrets
of Urithiru as well as advancing scholarly pursuits.
Artifabrians, historians, cartographers, and ardents
congregate here to run projects, study the Radiants,
and exchange research.
In contrast to traditional Alethi hierarchy, the
scholars of Urithiru have formed a meritocracy based
on achievement and notoriety. Those who demonstrate
innovative designs or sharp minds rise quickly in
esteem and are granted greater resources. Though these
rooms don’t rival the great libraries of Roshar, they’re
nevertheless becoming a thriving center of invention.
```

```
Mountains and Plateaus
The landscape around Urithiru is cold, desolate, and
harsh. Scouting efforts have mostly been limited to
overhead Radiant surveys, and so rumors abound
regarding unknown spren, long-forgotten ancient
treasures, and abandoned outposts. Those who’ve
ventured out warn of monstrous greatshells better suited
to the high altitude than the humans and singers.
Some occupants of Urithiru worry that the growing
activity in their city will draw the attention of unknown
threats better left alone. Others relish the adventure of
exploring the wilderness; such bold individuals might
find ancient lore, unearth valuable resources, or descend
the system of tunnels leading out of Urithiru and into
the mountains.
Unexplored Halls
The interior sections of Urithiru are a maze of cavernous
halls, winding corridors, ventilation shafts, and rooms
of all sizes. Long ago, the city was full of individual
neighborhoods, each with their own style, design,
and flavor. Though time has dulled the details, much
remains to be discovered—but there are never enough
people willing to brave the city’s unmapped areas.
Reports from explorers include unstable sections,
fabrial defenses, and evidence of prowling creatures in
the dark. But as the population of Urithiru grows, so
does the pressure to brave these hazards and expand the
city’s habitable areas. Hatham, the Highprince of Works,
pays handsomely for groups to chart the unknown
spaces, emphasizing the prestige of discovering more
lost knowledge, artifacts, or infrastructure.
```

```
Culture
During the True Desolation, Urithiru fills with
Radiants, soldiers, craftspeople, nobility, and laborers.
Tension between these groups grows due to the social
changes championed by Queen Jasnah.
```

```
Important Locations
Urithiru was built at an extremely high elevation in
the mountains of Ur. The tower city has ten levels,
each of which is subdivided into eighteen stories.
```

```
The Breakaway
A large open marketplace the size of a small town,
the Breakaway is chaotic, crowded, and boasts a wide
variety of goods and services. The various shops, eating
establishments, and entertainment opportunities range
in construction from roped-off areas softened by rugs
to permanent Soulcast structures.
Several groups wield visible influence here,
including the labor-focused water haulers’ guild,
the corrupt Third Watch, and the rising Vavanach
family—a criminal enterprise dealing in extortion.
Citizens who desire a less chaotic experience can
head to a tightly regulated subsection known as the
Ten Rings. Merchants in the Ten Rings pay taxes to
maintain fair trade and well-patrolled streets, a system
developed by Queen Navani. The Ten Rings is also
home to a popular tavern, Jez’s Duty, which serves
all strata of Alethi society.
The Cloudwalk
Near the heights of Urithiru, the Cloudwalk encircles
the eighth tier of the city and offers an incredible view
of the Mountains of Ur. Combining an open stone
pathway, a garden balcony, and numerous side chambers
and halls, the Cloudwalk has become a public space
where people of any nation and rank can meet, relax,
and exchange ideas.
Here, an Azish scholar might present a new math-
ematical proof in an amphitheater, or a Herdazian poet
might recite lines to a pair of young lovers—all while a
group of scheming Alethi nobles plots in an alcove and
a Ghostblood agent strains to catch their words.
Coalition members, foreign dignitaries, and all
sorts often take their leisure here, and the dense
interconnectedness of the rooms and halls makes
it difficult to track who is meeting with whom.

Important Locations
The highprinces’ warcamps are arranged from north to
south as follows: Roion, Sadeas, Aladar, Kholin, Vamah,
Ruthar, Thanadal, Hatham, Bethab, and Sebarial.
```

```
Roion
Highprince Roion is known for fielding exemplary
archers, and he’s eager to showcase this strength while
quelling accusations of cowardice within his armies.
To that end, the warcamp hosts the Range—a space
for archery competitions and staged “hunts.” Roion
soldiers often set aside spheres to bid for a shot at the
whitespines.
Sadeas
Highprince Sadeas’s warcamp is a mess, and the
cruelty of Sadeas soldiers is often visited on enslaved
people and civilians in the Outer Market. Sadeas
maintains the largest force of human bridgemen,
purchased as slaves or criminals and then sent to die
against listener arrows. The poor and desperate people
of this warcamp often seek aid and sanctuary from the
other nine.
```

```
Aladar
Highprince Aladar makes a passing attempt at shrewd
politics. His camp is a hotbed of intrigue, with guards
turning a blind eye to certain unsavory elements in the
hope of baiting out sources of information. Gambling
dens have thrived in this permissive environment.
Among the most notorious is the Red Rockbud—an
underground dive run by a Bavlander spy named Nel.
Kholin
Due to its close adherence to the Alethi Codes of War,
the Kholin warcamp is the picture of order, from the
carefully planned radial barracks to the blue uniforms
on every soldier. Most buildings are stark and utilitarian
Soulcast bunkers. Nevertheless, Kholin soldiers find
the time and place to indulge in drinking and other
entertainment. Bars such as the Ornery Chull offer
rowdy common rooms for darkeyed soldiers, along
with private dining for the rich.
After the True Desolation began, a small contingent
remained behind to maintain the remnants of the
warcamp, while Brightness Jasalai led the bulk of the
force to relocate to Urithiru.
```

```
Warcamps
Ten craters sweep the western edge of the Shattered
Plains, walled by storm-worn ridges. From above, it’s
clear the craters were once enormous stone domes, long
since collapsed. Within them, Alethkar established their
warcamps, along with a palace and a market. It was from
these camps that the Alethi highprinces waged their war
with the listeners.
When planning an adventure in the warcamps, you’ll
likely want to set it before the Everstorm, when the
camps are most active; the information in this section
focuses on that time. After the Alethi occupation
of Urithiru, all warcamps (other than Vamah and
Thanadal) were abandoned or left with a token force.
```

```
Overview
When creating adventures in the Alethi warcamps,
consider the following factors.
Culture
Each camp reflects the values of its highprince. They’re
largely self-sufficient, with their own markets, taverns,
and even brothels. Alethi war culture encourages whole
families to follow their soldiers on campaign, so women
organize the warcamps as administrators, scribes, and
quartermasters, while children are expected to learn
from their parents and peers.
```

```
Government
Each highprince claims the highest authority within
their own warcamp. However, King Elhokar and
Dalinar Kholin influence the highprinces with political
and military pressure—and they also control the camps’
food supplies. In the harsh environment of the Plains,
Soulcast grain remains the best way to feed the Alethi
armies, and all of Alethkar’s Soulcasters are leased to
the highprinces by the king.
```

```
The road needed a good scraping;
rockbud polyps caused nearby
wagons to rattle and bump as
they passed. Most of the stalls had
a guard prominently stationed
near the goods. This wasn’t the
sort of place where you trusted the
local soldiers to police for you.
```

**164** Chapter 6: Points of Interest

EREL MAATITA
```

Ruthar
The aggression of Ruthar’s soldiers is well known.
They’re often seen as an easy target, and dueling culture
is rife. While nobles duel for politics and Shards, many
enlisted men in the Ruthar warcamp take part in brutal
fights in secret underground rings. Soldiers often pool
their earnings to create a prize pool for the fights, and the
winners have been known to fund their own desertion.

Thanadal and Vamah
Both Thanadal and Vamah have attempted to make
gains out of the conflicts between the other highprinces.
When the Alethi armies relocated to Urithiru in the
wake of the Everstorm, Vamah and Thanadal carved
out a new kingdom for themselves in the Shattered
Plains. To consolidate their power, Thanadal started
building his information sources into a spanreed
network to rival Tashikk, while Vamah indulged his
lighteyed subjects with wine tastings and feasts.
The Sons of Honor accepted both highprinces
into their ranks. The two treat their warcamps as
princedoms-in-exile, plotting against the Kholin family
while making dangerous allies. This has attracted the
attention of the Ghostbloods, who seek to infiltrate or
assassinate the Sons of Honor.

```
Hatham
Hatham’s use of ardents as political tools has earned
him an unfavorable reputation. Masquerading as a
devoted Vorin, Hatham has cultivated a strong ardentia
presence in his warcamp. The camp’s Devotary of
Kelek is perhaps the largest monastery on the Shattered
Plains. Rumors circulate that beneath the monastery,
a Soulcaster secretly experiments with unusual metals
at Hatham’s behest.
```

```
Bethab
At the center of Bethab politics lies the keen mind
of Mishinah, the highprince’s wife. In a deliberate
attempt to rival Navani’s scientific prowess, Mishinah
hosts the Bethab Society—a lighteyed ladies’ scholarly
club. Its ornate chapterhouse rivals the highprince’s
manor, and romantic trysts between the women
working as scribes and scientists are not uncommon
within its halls.

```

```
Sebarial
Recognizing how long the Alethi would be fighting their
war, Highprince Turinad Sebarial planned for long-term
settlement of the Plains. His warcamp has therefore
developed more advanced amenities and integrates
Soulcast bunkers with traditional buildings. Cultivated
fields to the southwest produce lavis grain, reducing his
reliance on Soulcasters.
The thriving economy of the Sebarial camp is well
known, and stewards from other camps send envoys to
barter for in-demand goods and military equipment.
Brightness Chanan, a distant Sebarial cousin, runs an
auction each dawn.
Owing to the influence of Sebarial’s mistress Palona,
the warcamp hosts the largest Herdazian community
outside the nation itself. Little Herdaz is the perfect
place to meet a new cousin.
```

```
The Outer Market
Operating outside the purview of any one highprince,
the centrally located Outer Market is an eclectic mix of
shops, restaurants, and winehouses. As neutral ground,
this market is a battlefield for politics and courtship—
as well as for fights between drunken soldiers from
rival camps.
Thaylen merchants were quick to take advantage
of the unregulated markets, and throughout the War
of Reckoning, they offered the best place to acquire
luxuries and contraband from distant lands. However,
since the relocation to Urithiru, the markets have fallen
into disrepair.
The Pinnacle
King Elhokar’s palace—the Pinnacle—rises from a
hill beside the Outer Market. The Pinnacle was carved
from the hill and embellished with Soulcast stone.
Protected on most sides by a sheer drop, this palace is a
fitting bastion for a wartime monarch. Surrounding the
palace grounds lie gardens, the feasting basin (which
hosts the king’s parties), and the dueling arena (where
the lighteyes delight in formal contests).

Three Seas
The Rosharan subastral includes three large seas:
Sea of Lost Lights. This sea encompasses the eastern
areas of Roshar, including Alethkar, Jah Keved,
Herdaz, Thaylenah, and the Frostlands. It notably
contains the trading port Celebrant.
Sea of Regret. This sea encompasses the western areas
of Roshar, including Shinovar, Iri, and Rira.
Sea of Souls. This sea encompasses the central areas of
Roshar, including most of the Azish Empire. It notably
contains the honorspren capital Lasting Integrity and
the trading village Nameless.
```

```
Seas of Beads
Oceans, lakes, and rivers in Shadesmar aren’t made of
liquid, but of small beads of dark glass approximately
the size of a fingernail. It’s impossible for humans to
swim through these strange “waters.” The beads drag
people down, fill their mouths and throats, and capture
them in strong, deep currents. This is especially true
for Surgebinders, as the beads are drawn to Stormlight
and they respond unpredictably when surges are
used nearby.
Though each bead is simply a piece of glass in the
Cognitive Realm, it represents the soul of a non-living
item in the Physical Realm. The beads swirl together
in a vast expanse of dark, clacking glass, but they stay
roughly in the area corresponding to their objects’
locations in the Physical Realm. If a bead is picked up,
moved, then dropped, it slowly makes its way back to its
original location, as it’s drawn to the object it represents.
As discussed in the following sections, some people
can sense the souls of beads, temporarily manifest
those objects in Shadesmar, shape the beads into
simple structures, and even Soulcast objects in the
Physical Realm.

he Cognitive Realm is the realm of
thought and the home of the cognitive aspects
of living and non-living things. If the Physical
Realm is the body and the Spiritual Realm is the soul,
the Cognitive Realm is the mind, giving form to the
sheer concepts of things normally without form.
As the birthplace of spren, Shadesmar and the
Cognitive Realm are deeply important to Roshar. While
inhabitants of every planet can use the Cognitive Realm
to travel to new worlds, Roshar’s past, present, and
future are inextricably tied to Shadesmar.
The Cognitive Realm encompasses all worlds,
as described in this book’s introduction. The name
Shadesmar—Rosharan for Cognitive Realm—is
sometimes applied specifically to the areas of the realm
that correspond to Roshar, but many worldhoppers
use it as a term for the entire Cognitive Realm. This
chapter focuses on the areas of Shadesmar within the
Rosharan system.
```

```
Geography
The Cognitive Realm is a single infinite plane of
connected subastrals—areas which correspond
to planetary systems in the cosmere. However, its
geography often appears as an inverted version of the
Physical Realm: Shadesmar’s “seas” of beads mirror
Roshar’s lands, while Shadesmar’s obsidian lands
correspond with Roshar’s oceans, rivers, and lakes.
Though these areas reflect each other, they aren’t
an exact replica, as Shadesmar is affected by people’s
perceptions of objects, space, and dimension. For
example, the size of each area within Shadesmar is
influenced by how many people think within and about
that area in the Physical Realm. As a result, the empty
space between planets is vastly smaller in Shadesmar,
while populated areas are much closer in size to their
physical counterparts.

Gleaning Impressions From Beads
Some people—especially those who are Invested—can
glean impressions from a bead to determine which
object it represents in the Physical Realm.
When you touch a bead with your bare hand, if you’re
currently Invested (with 1 Investiture or more) or if
you succeed on a DC 15 Insight test, you gain a brief
glimpse in your mind of that bead’s object. This usually
happens immediately, but if you’re touching too many
beads at once, the impressions become overwhelming,
making it hard to disentangle all the impressions
simultaneously flashing before your mind.
```

```
Locating Beads
The seas of Shadesmar are filled with an incalculable
number of objects. If you’re seeking a particular object
among the roiling and clacking spheres (usually with the
intent of manifesting its object, as described in the next
section), this presents a formidable challenge.
The most reliable way to find the bead you want is to
spend time sorting through hundreds of them. When
you take a short rest, you can forgo recovery and instead
spend your time searching through the beads of the
sea. When you do, you can usually identify a bead that
matches the general criteria you’re looking for, which
you can then carry with you for later use. The beads you
can find are up to the GM’s discretion; you’re unlikely to
find a specific unique object, but within reason, you can
usually find something that meets your general needs.
If you instead need to find a bead quickly, you can
Use a Skill to make an Insight test; on a success, you
find that bead. The DC of this test is set by the GM
based on how specific and rare of an object you’re
looking for. The GM is encouraged to raise the stakes
on this test, and they can spend C to present an object
that has challenging consequences. For example, if
you’re looking for a lantern but roll a Complication,
you might find a piece of broken glass instead.
Manifesting Objects From Beads
Manifesting the souls of beads is rare but drives much
of the trade within Shadesmar. A skillful wielder of
Stormlight can expose a bead to Investiture, and in so
doing, create a facsimile in Shadesmar of the object it
represents. The time a manifested item lasts depends
on how much Stormlight is infused into it.
An object replicated in this way continues to exist in
the Physical Realm while manifested in Shadesmar.
Object Size
Your ranks in Discipline determine how large of an
object you can attempt to manifest, as shown on the
Manifested Bead Size chart. The object can’t exceed
that size in width, length, or height.
```

```
Manifested Bead Size
Ranks Size
1 Small (2.5 feet)
2 Medium (5 feet)
3 Large (10 feet)
4 Huge (15 feet)
5 Gargantuan (20 feet)
```

```
Manifesting an Object
Once you’ve located a bead you want to manifest,
make a Discipline test; the DC for this test is usually
10, but the GM might increase or decrease it based on
the object’s complexity. On a success, you must infuse
1 Investiture or more into the bead, then it immediately
transforms into the physical object it represents.
The object expends 1 Investiture each day; when all
infused Investiture is expended, the object reverts back
to a bead.
If you don’t have Investiture yourself, manifesting
an object becomes more difficult. You can instead infuse
Investiture from an unencased gem you’re carrying, but
when you attempt to manifest in this way, the DC of
your Discipline test increases by 5.
```

**170** Chapter 7: Shadesmar

```
Shaping Beads Into Structures
Skilled Surgebinders can channel Stormlight to build
simple structures, drawing beads into a latticework.
These structures are strong, able to bear weight and
resist impact while Invested with Stormlight.
As with manifesting, you still need a bead to pattern
your structure after; however, since you don’t need
to test Discipline with this technique, it’s commonly
used to build more complicated objects like bridges,
platforms, and tunnels that allow Surgebinders to
navigate the bead sea.
Structure Size
Your ranks in Crafting determine how large of an object
or structure you can attempt to create, as shown on the
Bead Structure Size chart. The object can’t exceed that
size in either width, length, or height.
```

```
Bead Structure Size
Ranks Size
1 Small (2.5 feet)
2 Medium (5 feet)
3 Large (10 feet)
4 Huge (15 feet)
5 Gargantuan (20 feet)
```

```
Creating a Structure
To create an object or structure from beads, choose a
bead that represents the object you want to create, then
infuse 1 Investiture or more into it. Other nearby beads
immediately form around it to create the structure.
The structure expends 1 Investiture each round; when
all infused Investiture is expended, the latticework
collapses and the beads scatter.
You can create armor or weapons in this way, but
they aren’t as sturdy as their physical counterparts. Each
time you’re hit by an attack while wearing such armor,
its deflect value reduces by 1, and all weapons created in
this way have the Fragile trait.
```

```
Soulcasting From Shadesmar
Skilled Lightweavers and Elsecallers can even Soulcast
from Shadesmar. If you have 3 or more ranks in the
Transformation skill, you can use your Transformation
surge on a bead within reach, spending an additional
1 Investiture to do so. When you do, you Soulcast the
bead’s Physical aspect, transforming it in the Physical
Realm as if you were there instead of in Shadesmar.
```

```
Dangers of the Seas
The beads of Shadesmar are seemingly drawn to
Investiture. In their masses, they can form waves and
swirl dangerously around Surgebinders who are using
their powers.
When you test a surge skill while near a sea of beads,
raise the stakes. You can spend O to direct the flow of
the beads around yourself, allowing you to move up to
15 feet without triggering a Reactive Strike. However,
the GM can spend C to cause the swirling beads to
knock you off your feet, dealing 1d6 impact damage
and potentially pushing you into the sea.
```

```
Flames of People
If Shadesmar’s beads represent the souls of objects, the
small flames found throughout the realm represent the
souls of living creatures. These flames hover just above
the ground, producing small pockets of light (but not
heat). Sapient beings have larger flames than those of
other creatures.
```

```
Reading the Flames
You can gain impressions of a person by looking at their
flame with a discerning eye. A soul’s flame turns a vivid
red if corrupted by Odium or Sja-anat, while a Fused’s
soul is a darker, pulsing flame.
When you touch a flame, you can Use a Skill to
make an Insight test against the Spiritual defense of
the character whose flame you’re touching. On a success,
you gain an impression of the person it represents, often
accompanied by their emotions and thoughts.
```

```
Land and Sky
Shadesmar’s lands are an expanse of cold black
obsidian. The glassy obsidian can be used for tools or
building materials. As it shatters easily, the inhabitants
of Shadesmar don’t rely on it, but this obsidian is easily
Soulcast into other materials.
The velvet-black sky of Shadesmar has only a small
white sun. This sun doesn’t light the sky and only softly
illuminates the land. It never moves, regardless of time
or location. Shadows created by the sun point toward
it instead of away, but other light sources (such as
manifested fires) create normal shadows that point away
from the light.
```

```
Chapter 7: Shadesmar 171

ARI IBARRA

```
Flora
Trees and other plants in Shadesmar are made of obsid-
ian, glass, or crystal, and they come in a variety of col-
ors. Some are reminiscent of the Physical Realm, while
others—such as Shadesmar’s mushroom-shaped trees—
aren’t related at all. Many plants shatter if touched, but
others can withstand more force. They sometimes form
forests, such as the ones that surround the Thaylenah
Oathgate and the honorspren capital Lasting Integrity.
```

```
Fauna
Creatures from the Physical Realm can be trans-
ported—sometimes unwittingly—into Shades mar
via a perpendicularity or Oathgate.
Animals typically appear the same in Shadesmar as
they do in the Physical Realm. However, Ryshadium
horses are trailed by faint outlines of light, leaving
afterimages of themselves that disappear; these lines
are created by the musicspren who bonded them.
```

```
Climate and Weather
Shadesmar’s unusual climate doesn’t have humidity,
precipitation, or temperature changes. Instead, its
weather can include visible phenomena, changes in plant
growth, and fluctuations in the emotions and well-being
of spren. The following are examples of Shadesmar
weather patterns:
Crystalline Days. Plants grow faster during crystalline
days, when shimmering violet-pink haze drifts along
the horizon.
Energetic Weather. On energetic days, spren become
cheerful and talkative thanks to a faint, upbeat
drumming in the back of their minds.
Highstorms. A highstorm creates vibrant ripples and
colors in the sky as well as luminescent, shimmering
clouds. In Shadesmar, these storms don’t infuse
spheres with Stormlight, but they do revitalize
Radiant spren.
```

```
Diplomatic Relations
The interactions of Roshar’s people, worldhoppers,
Radiant spren, and Odium’s forces have political
ramifications throughout Shadesmar, particularly
regarding Radiant spren.
```

```
Radiants and Spren
Since the Recreance, the relationship between humans
and spren has ranged from tense to directly hostile. The
Recreance wiped out many Radiant spren, leaving their
societies mistrustful and furious.
The Knights Radiant of Urithiru recently reforged
diplomatic relationships with the honorspren (see
“Oathgates and Armies” in chapter 4). As a result, the
relationship between humans and spren has begun to
mend, though some spren still have reservations and
withhold their complete trust.
Trade and Stormlight
Lightspren and peakspren are traders and sailors who
transport goods between Shadesmar’s port cities. Trade
focuses on items imported from the Physical Realm,
which are much rarer and last indefinitely. Items like
non-manifested weapons and Rosharan wines are
particularly popular.
Stormlight serves not only as Shadesmar’s major
currency, but as a valued commodity. It can be used to
manifest objects for later sale; each manifested item’s
price reflects how long it’ll last in Shadesmar.
Spren are no strangers to trading with worldhoppers
and have some knowledge of other planets and the
inhabitants thereof. Many worldhoppers, particularly
the Ghostbloods, are keenly interested in finding a
way to transport Investiture off Roshar and through
the Cognitive Realm. To this end, they’re trying to
set up a trade route.
```

```
Voidspren and Fused
As the True Desolation begins, Odium’s forces
control regions of Shadesmar, including Celebrant
and Cultivation’s Perpendicularity. Voidspren spread
their influence across the realm while the Fused patrol
occupied cities and seek to capture even more. Odium’s
forces are aggressively laying the groundwork for an
empire in the Cognitive Realm.
Honorspren and Fused have a strained relationship,
but some honorspren suggest that because singers are
the rightful heirs of Roshar, the honorspren should
follow the example of the highspren and side with
the Fused and Odium. Such a decision would likely
influence other spren cultures to follow suit.
```

```

**172** Chapter 7: Shadesmar

Shadesmar Spren

Spren comprise most of Shadesmar’s population.
These beings are created when Investiture coalesces
in one place and becomes imprinted with a collective
concept. Particularly strong concepts can even become
personified, creating a sapient spren—a rare event
that sometimes occurs quickly and other times spans
centuries.
The following sections discuss spren in relation
to Shadesmar, including their societies and culture.
To learn about the different types of spren, see “Spren”
in chapter 1.

Categories of

Shadesmar Spren

Radiant spren take on a humanoid shape and size while
in Shadesmar. These sapient spren have organized into
settlements and cities, typically divided by spren type.
Meanwhile, lesser spren roam Shadesmar, feeding
on emotions. These non-sapient spren are especially
active in the seas, as they’re drawn to cities and other
large masses of people. When a person experiences
strong emotions, the corresponding emotion spren can
be partially pulled into the Physical Realm. Natural
phenomena in the Physical Realm can also draw lesser
spren through.
Some spren are trapped in the Physical Realm,
confined to gemstones in fabrials and Soulcasters.
These typically manifest in the Cognitive Realm as
small, unresponsive beings with closed eyes. One such
spren is the Sibling, one of the Bondsmith spren. In the
Physical Realm, the Sibling manifests as and controls
many fabrials throughout Urithiru; in Shadesmar, they
appear as a mountain of bright light resembling the
city-tower.
Deadeyes are seemingly mindless spren who
were “killed” when their Nahel bond was broken in
the Recreance. They exist physically in Shadesmar,
appearing much the same as they once did, but their
form is more decrepit and their eyes are scratched
out. Deadeyes can be drawn into the Physical Realm
as Shardblades—making them temporarily disappear
from Shadesmar—but their Shardblade form can’t
be summoned in the Cognitive Realm. Left to their
own devices, deadeyes wander Shadesmar, trying
to reach the location of whomever has bonded
their Shardblade; however, spren societies typically
imprison or care for deadeyes to keep them from
wandering off and being hurt.

```
Lesser Spren
Shadesmar doesn’t have creatures like those inhabiting
the Physical Realm. Instead, it’s filled with the many
lesser spren who crawl, swim and fly around the
oceans of beads. These are primarily emotion spren,
as most nature spren have a stronger anchor to the
Physical Realm.
When people travel through Shadesmar, emotion
spren respond to their emotions in much the same way
they do in the Physical Realm. A strong emotion can
prompt spren to come flocking out of the sea of beads.
In some cases, this simply makes it harder to hide your
true feelings—but with more aggressive spren like
angerspren, this can become dangerous.
```

```
Emotion Spren Appearances
In Shadesmar, emotion spren appear very different
from their representations in the Physical Realm. In the
Physical Realm, you might see merely a glowing orb or
a red streamer, but that’s just one part of a much larger,
complex creature. Each of these beings has mass and
substance in the Cognitive Realm, and some spren can
even pose significant danger to people who travel in
Shadesmar.
The following list describes how some emotion spren
appear in Shadesmar:
Angerspren are lithe, six-legged pack predators
with whip-like tails and spines. Their toothy maws
constantly drool blood. (Chapter 8 presents a stat
block for these spren.)
Anticipationspren are lurg-like creatures with round,
bulbous bodies. When one senses anticipation, they
unfurl their mouth, revealing the red, streamer-like
tongue that’s seen in the Physical Realm.
Fearspren are sizable eel-like creatures with stumpy
legs. The part of them that manifests in the Physical
Realm is the purple glob at the end of their single
spindly antenna.
Painspren are diminutive orange humanoids, faceless
and gaunt. Their sinewy, grasping hands appear in the
Physical Realm. (Chapter 8 presents a stat block for
these spren.)
Luckspren , known as mandras in Shadesmar, are far
larger than their Physical Realm manifestations, with
sinuous bodies and arrow-shaped heads. Radiant spren
sailors use mandras to pull their vessels through the
bead ocean.
Starspren resemble enormous greatshells with seven
sets of wings. They are trailed by clouds and dotted
by pinpricks of light, which are all that can be seen
of them from the Physical Realm.

of Celebrant.

```
Using Lesser Spren
During gameplay, lesser spren mostly act as interesting
set dressing for the group’s travels through Shadesmar.
However, they have two significant effects:
Discerning Emotions. Since emotion spren are more
visible than in the Physical Realm, characters gain an
advantage on tests to discern the true emotions or
motives of a person in Shadesmar.
Flaring Tempers. When tempers begin to heat and
negative emotions begin to flare, the GM should
raise the stakes on social tests. The GM can spend
C to cause nearby angerspren to take interest
(see chapter 8 for their stat block).
```

```
Radiant Spren Societies
Many Radiant spren settlements, cities, and trading
ports thrive throughout Shadesmar. The following are
some of the notable ones.
```

```
Celebrant
Celebrant is in the Sea of Lost Lights. This major
population center and trading port has docks longer
than the city itself and a bountiful open-stall market.
The Voidspren have taken command of Celebrant,
though only a few Fused remain in the city and their
control is limited.
Humans can find passage at the docks, provided they
can find a crew willing to take passengers. The market
sells clothing, building materials, art, weapons, and food
(primarily canned).
Lasting Integrity
Lasting Integrity is the honorspren capital in the Sea
of Souls. This hollow, roofless fortress of blue stone
is hundreds of feet tall, and its walls are fortified and
heavily guarded. Each wall has its own gravitational
field, allowing inhabitants to walk up the vertical surface
as if it were ground. These walls serve as foundations
for the many buildings that rise toward the interior of
the city. However, buildings remain short—typically
one story tall—as anything too far from a wall exits the
gravitational field and plummets.
Within the fortress stand statues of the honorspren
killed during the Recreance, as well as a library, an
amphitheater-like forum, an Investiture storehouse,
and residential areas. Official buildings, such as the
```

```
building of justice, are clustered on the western wall
near the base. Stone walkways connect the city’s
buildings with its beautiful, orderly gardens.
Lasting Integrity is the home of the Herald Kalak,
who serves as the honorspren High Judge.
Nameless
Nameless is a port and coastal outpost in the Sea of
Souls. Built outside lands controlled by spren nations
(or the Fused), it operates independently and is a relative
safe haven for humans. The small outpost and its four
streets offer a wealth of trading opportunities. Most
shops are run by cultivationspren, and many merchants
speak human languages. Here, travelers can buy and sell
many goods, including books, weapons, food, and water.
```

```
Traveling to Shadesmar
Three primary methods allow travel to Shadesmar from
Roshar: the Oathgates, Cultivation’s Perpendicularity,
and the surge of Transportation.
```

```
Oathgates
It’s relatively easy to travel to Shadesmar via an
Oathgate. These remarkable fabrials use the surge of
Transportation to create a network of gateways, enabling
near-instantaneous travel between them.
The Oathgates exist simultaneously in the Physical
Realm and in Shadesmar. In the Physical Realm, each
appears as an arena-sized platform of marble, with a
bridge leading up to the platform. In Shadesmar, the
platform is merely the size of the control building,
and only people and things inside the control building
are transferred. The Oathgate spren—two enormous
armored spren, one black and one white—hold spears
and keep sharp vigil.
At some point in the past, the Oathgates were
closed off when the Sibling forbade the Oathgate
spren from facilitating travel to the Cognitive
Realm. However, some Oathgate spren have since
recognized the Stormfather’s authority in the Sibling’s
absence, allowing travel to Shadesmar after the
Everstorm’s arrival.
```

```
Operating an Oathgate
Anyone wielding a living Shardblade or an Honorblade
can operate the Oathgate, choosing to travel either
to another Oathgate in the Physical Realm or to an
Oathgate’s counterpart in Shadesmar.
Oathgates also require Stormlight to function. Each
Oathgate can hold a small amount of Stormlight in its
ten gemstones—enough to transport a single person.
Transporting larger groups usually expends 3 marks
worth of infused gems for each additional person
```

```
Chapter 7: Shadesmar 175
```

MARIE SEEBERGER

```
transported; however, if the Stormlight in the Oathgate’s
gemstones has already been depleted, it requires an
additional 50 marks to activate. Notably, Radiants of
higher Ideals require less Stormlight to operate these
fabrials; a Radiant of the Fourth Ideal needs only
2 marks per person (plus 35 to activate the gate), and a
Radiant of the Fifth Ideal needs only 1 mark per person
(plus 20 to activate the gate).
Oathgate Locations
During the Silver Kingdoms era, each of the ten nations
possessed one Oathgate. They correspond to the
following locations in modern Roshar:
Akinah. The Aimia Oathgate is located in Akinah.
Once believed destroyed, it has since been uncovered,
though it remains locked.
Alethkar. The Alethela Oathgate is located in Kholinar.
The Oathgate spren were corrupted by the Unmade
Sja-anat. Though unlocked, the Voidbringers currently
control this Oathgate.
Azir. The Makabakam Oathgate is located in Azimir.
It’s unlocked and operational.
Babatharnam. The Sela Tales Oathgate is located in
Panatham. It remains locked and is believed to be
under the control of Iriali forces allied with Odium.
Iri. The Iri Oathgate is located in Rall Elorim. It remains
locked, and as the Iri leaders have allied with Odium,
the Oathgate is under their control.
Jah Keved. The Valhav Oathgate is located in Vedenar,
which has allied with Odium. It’s unlocked and
operational.
Rira. The Rishir Oathgate is located in Kurth. It remains
locked and is believed to be under the control of Iriali
forces allied with Odium.
Shattered Plains. The Natanatan Oathgate is located
in the center of the Shattered Plains. It’s unlocked and
operational.
Shinovar. The Shin Kak Nish Oathgate is hidden
in Shinovar. It remains locked.
Thaylenah. The Thalath Oathgate is located in Thaylen
City. It’s unlocked and operational.
```

```
Cultivation’s Perpendicularity
Cultivation’s Perpendicularity is located in the Horneater
oceans on the Horneater Peaks in Roshar. The only
known stable perpendicularity on Roshar, it allows for
travel between the Physical Realm and Shadesmar. The
Unkalaki know it as the “water of life,” and through it,
they occasionally visit the “place of the gods.”
While the perpendicularity’s stability should allow
for safe travel between realms, there is a complication:
```

```
Voidbringers control its region in the Cognitive Realm,
thus restricting travel through the perpendicularity.
Some humans believe it’s still the safest way to travel
back to the Physical Realm, but the Fused have
increased their influence through warships that haunt
the region’s waters.
```

```
Surge of Transportation
The surge of Transportation allows Elsecallers and
Willshapers to travel between the Cognitive and
Physical Realms. A less experienced Surgebinder can
move themself between realms, while a Radiant of
higher Ideals can create a temporary perpendicularity
to transport not only themself, but other beings as well.
It’s easier to enter the Cognitive Realm; leaving it
is much more difficult. To travel back to the Physical
Realm, inexperienced Surgebinders must find a
point where the Physical Realm and the Cognitive
Realm touch.
```

```
Worldhopping
The nature of the Cognitive Realm allows travel
between other worlds of the cosmere. As discussed
in “Geography” earlier in this chapter, distances in
Shadesmar are highly relative. As a result, it’s possible
to quickly travel the vast empty spaces between
worlds. This enables individuals (such as Hoid) and
organizations (such as the Ghostbloods) to operate on
a cosmere-wide scale.
```

```
Odium’s Forces
Odium can move Cognitive Shadows and certain
Unmade between realms by giving them command
of a physical host’s body.
```

```
GM Tip: Stormlight in Shadesmar
Stormlight (and Investiture in general) is a precious
resource in Shadesmar. It’s the primary currency used in
spren society and it can manifest items from beads, but
Stormlight doesn’t replenish in a highstorm like it does in
the Physical Realm. Worst of all, spheres slowly leak their
light until they go dun.
This means that most adventures in the Cognitive
Realm are defined by how the party conserves Stormlight.
If your game doesn’t usually keep track of infused spheres,
you’re encouraged to start doing so while adventuring
in Shadesmar. This can create an interesting and
tense adventure as the group carefully conserves their
Stormlight for the right trade, surge, or fabrial.
```

**176** Chapter 7: Shadesmar

```
Adventuring in Shadesmar
When your characters travel to Shadesmar, it’s much
the same as adventuring anywhere else. You travel
across mountains, sail ships across the seas, negotiate
with merchants, and fight hostile creatures—just
in an environment that’s a bit more alien than the
Physical Realm.
Most rules from the Stormlight Handbook apply in the
Cognitive Realm. However, food and water, as well as
some of the most sought-after pieces of gear on Roshar,
work very differently.
```

```
Gear in the Cognitive Realm
Most gear carries over normally into Shadesmar.
However, items that are a physical manifestation of a
cognitive entity may appear differently. This primarily
affects Shardblades, Soulcasters, and Shardplate.
Shardblades
Radiant Shardblades and dead Shardblades can’t be
summoned while in Shadesmar. Instead, the Blade’s
spren accompanies the Blade’s bonded wielder.
By contrast, Honorblades aren’t formed out of spren,
and thus these Blades maintain their usual form and
powers in Shadesmar.
Radiant Shardblades
As a Radiant character in Shadesmar, your bonded
spren appears as a full-sized person with unique
features determined by their spren type (see “Spren”
in chapter 1). They’re fixed in that form, just as you’re
fixed to yours in the Physical Realm.
In Shadesmar, Radiant spren can’t change shape,
fly, or disappear as they would in the Physical Realm.
As a result, they can’t use their Covert Scouting or
Sudden Warning ability here.
Dead Shardblades
Like Radiant Shardblades, “dead” Shardblades are
made from spren—but these spren died when their
Radiant betrayed their oaths during the Recreance.
When you travel to Shadesmar, your Blade’s deadeye
appears by your side. As long as you maintain the bond
to your Blade, they follow you—placid, silent, and
watching with their scratched-out eyes.
You can’t interact with your Blade’s deadeye.
Most attempts elicit silence—plus the occasional
blood-curdling scream. However, rumors claim that
Adolin Kholin has connected with his blade’s spren,
Mayalaran, in a way thought impossible. If Adolin
has gotten through to Maya through consideration,
persistence, and likely a dose of his incontestable
charisma, maybe others can as well?
```

```
Shardplate
Shardplate can’t travel over to Shadesmar, whether the
Plate is Radiant or dead. However, unlike Shardblades,
nothing appears in the Cognitive Realm. Instead,
dead Plate is left in the Physical Realm where you
departed from. Meanwhile, the spren that comprise
your Radiant Plate might appear around you at times
(depending on the spren type and their connection to
the Cognitive Realm).
```

```
Soulcasters
Like Shardblades, your Soulcaster can’t travel with you
to Shadesmar. In its place appears a small, unresponsive
spren, hovering with their eyes closed. As a result, if you
usually use a Soulcaster for the Transformation surge,
you can’t do so in Shadesmar.

```

```
Food, Water, and Survival
Being attacked by angerspren or drowning under an
oppressive sea of beads might seem like the greatest
dangers of traveling through Shadesmar. In reality,
the greatest dangers are far simpler: dehydration and
starvation.
The Cognitive Realm doesn’t have food or water
readily available in the wilderness, so foraging for
basic needs is out of the question. A group who finds
themselves stranded in Shadesmar without supplies can
be in a difficult situation. Luckily, enough humans visit
this realm that spren traders usually have physical food
ready and available for trade. If you have Stormlight,
you can trade it for rations, or even for food packed
in a strange metal tin.
Hydrator fabrials, which condense water from the
air, are the best source of water in Shadesmar. Many
traders use them, so water is readily available for trade.
If you run out of food and water, chapter 9 of
the Stormlight Handbook describes the effects in
the “Food and Water” section.

Shadesmar Scenes
Shadesmar is rife with strange experiences and lurking
dangers. As the adventurers traverse this realm, the GM
can use scenes to escalate the narrative. For each day of
travel (or at the GM’s discretion), roll a d20 and consult

Bandits
Shadesmar has seen no small number of greedy human
traders hoping to capitalize on Roshar’s wealth of
Investiture. The party is attacked by a group of human
bandits (see chapter 8) who aim to take everything they
have to trade with spren and worldhoppers.
```

```
Drowning
Panicked cries echo off the obsidian from somewhere
nearby. A trader hoping to reach Celebrant is being
dragged down into the ocean, beads already garbling
his cries as they press into his mouth.
```

```
High Tensions
A group of human travelers are attacking an honorspren.
The travelers claim she attacked a highspren who was
accompanying them, but the honorspren appears to be
the only spren present.
```

```
Lesser Spren
Aggressive lesser spren—such as angerspren or
painspren (see chapter 8)—swarm the characters.
They might be seeking Investiture, or they might be
drawn by the group’s emotions.
```

```
Fused
A group of Fused scouts patrols the area, searching
for spren settlements or pushing back human travelers.
These Fused could be flying Heavenly Ones, elusive
Husked Ones, armored Magnified Ones, or any of the
other brands (see chapter 8).
```

```
Worldhopper
The characters encounter a friendly Worldhopper who
is willing to trade intriguing items from other worlds
for Stormlight.

```
he world of Roshar is an epic stage for
heroic stories, for tales of remarkable people
who become Radiant, but the road to Radiance
isn’t an easy one. Just as our favorite heroes—Kaladin,
Shallan, Dalinar, and more—persevered through
hardship, so too should yours.
Adversaries offer a variety of fearsome and intriguing
challenges for player characters. Some battles are fought
with a quick blade, others with a sharp tongue. Even the
mightiest heroes know better than to underestimate an
opponent’s cleverness, ferocity, or resourcefulness.
This chapter provides tools for GMs to present
archetypal friends, foes, and beasts—from the terrifying
chasmfiend to the lowly cremling, and from the proud
Shardbearer to the ancient Fused.
```

```
Using Adversaries
Each adversary in this chapter represents a type of
character you can include in your adventures. The
adversary’s profile begins with a description of who
or what they are, meant to spark creativity and help
you fit them into your unfolding narrative. At the end
of each profile, you’ll find a stat block that represents
the adversary’s statistics and abilities, along with a
sidebar describing their common tactics in combat.
The upcoming “Reading Stat Blocks” section
summarizes how to use each adversary’s stat block.
Chapter 13 of the Stormlight Handbook presents full
adversary rules, and chapter 10 presents general rules
for combat.
```

```
Choosing Stat Blocks
If you’re using a prewritten adventure and a scene calls
for you to introduce an adversary, the adventure likely
tells you which adversaries to use, and their names
appear in bold to indicate there’s a stat block available.
For example, if the adventure says “two axehounds
approach,” use the axehound stat block twice.
```

```
If you’re creating a scene of your own, see
“Building Combat Scenes” in chapter 13 of the
Stormlight Handbook ; there, you’ll find guidance on
creating a good balance of interesting adversaries.
At the end of this book, an appendix presents
an alphabetical list of all stat blocks in this chapter.
You can find additional adversaries in other Cosmere
RPG products. This includes NPCs from published
adventures, animal companions for PCs (found in the
appendix of the Stormlight Handbook ), and characters
from other worlds (found in other world guides in the
Cosmere RPG).
```

```
Allies or Opponents?
Though the language of “adversary” implies opposition,
none of the listed NPCs and creatures detailed in this
chapter need be encountered in a hostile context. In
the events of the Stormlight Archive novels, even the
Fused—servants of Odium—can be encountered in
contexts of cooperation and mutual respect.
Similarly, adversaries who oppose the party might
not be doing so out of malice, but rather to encourage
growth. For example, a swordmaster ardent might
challenge a PC to test their skills with a Shardblade.
Other adversaries encountered by your party might
not be opponents or opposition, but simply friends.
These could be fellow soldiers or Shardbearers rendering
aid on the battlefield, or a PC’s loyal Ryshadium or
axehound defending their chosen companion.
```

```
Adversaries and the World State
This chapter presents a diverse range of people and
creatures found across Roshar, but not every adversary is
appropriate for every Rosharan campaign. When crafting
scenes and choosing allies or enemies for the party to
meet, create an authentic experience by considering which
era your story is set in. For example, PCs who are on the
Shattered Plains during the events of The Way of Kings
won’t encounter the Fused—unless you decide to make
a creative exception and cleverly subvert your players’
expectations.

Where to Encounter
Adversaries
Many profiles provide ideas of where you can encounter
those adversaries, but it can feel overwhelming to
navigate all the possibilities, especially if you’re new to
the world of Roshar.
Chapter 6 of this book offers scene ideas for each
point of interest in that chapter. Similarly, chapter 7
provides inspiration in the “Shadesmar Scenes” section.
The upcoming sections offer further ideas for scenes
in general environments like the city, wilderness, or
ocean. You can roll on or choose from the table in
each section to inspire a related scene. Feel free to use
these ideas wholesale or creatively adapt them for your
own story.
```

```
City Scenes
Major city centers across Roshar allow the characters to
explore unique cultures, meet new people, and discover
new information.
```

```
d6 City Scene
1 The PCs are accosted by a city guard who claims the PCs
are suspects in a murder investigation.
2 The PCs are offered an audience with a local brightlord who
could become their patron.
3 The PCs witness a Skybreaker of the Second Ideal
grappling someone who is crying out for help.
4 The PCs are confronted by two thieves who try to sell them
a stolen pair of spanreeds at half the usual price.
5 The PCs learn that the information they need is being held
by a stubborn swordmaster ardent at the local devotary.
6 An earnest Windrunner squire entreats the characters to
free her mentor, who has been imprisoned by the citylord.
```

```
Wilderness Scenes
While traveling from one location to another, the
characters might encounter danger in Roshar’s
unforgiving wilderness.
```

```
d4 Wilderness Scene
1 The characters encounter a pack of wild axehounds.
2 The characters come across a herd of wild Ryshadium.
3 An unexpected highstorm hits, and as the characters seek
shelter, they enter the territory of a whitespine.
4 While days away from the nearest city, the party’s
transportation unexpectedly breaks down. Is it a simple
accident, or a trap by bandits?
```

```
Ocean Scenes
The continent of Roshar is surrounded by ocean, and
people brave the seas for travel and trade.
```

```
d4 Ocean Scene
1 While PCs are ashore during a break or sheltering from a
highstorm, hungry khornaks surround the party’s boat.
2 A sudden and unexpected storm besets the ship. Amid
the winds and rains, swooping figures begin plucking crew
members off the rigging. Heavenly Ones are concealing
themselves in the storm and attacking the ship.
3 The party sails toward what appears to be a friendly
Thaylen ship, only to realize it has been seized by Fused.
Now the only choices are to flee or face a ship filled with
singer  spear infantry and archers.
4 While navigating the shallows, the PCs hear scuttling on the
sides of their ship. A yu-nerig hauls itself on to the deck and
attacks—but why is it so enraged?
```

**184** Chapter 8: Adversaries and Bestiary

```
Surge Skills. If an adversary can wield Investiture,
their stat block also lists their surge skills, along with
the number of ranks they have in those skills.
Languages. If an adversary can speak or understand
languages, their stat block suggests which
languages to use.
Features. An adversary’s features provide special rules
that affect them but don’t directly require an action,
free action, or reaction to use.
Actions. As with PCs, an adversary can use any action,
free action, or reaction from chapter 10 of the
Stormlight Handbook. They can also use any action,
free action, or reaction listed in their stat block; these
follow the same rules as PC actions, and each can be
used only once per turn. See the upcoming “Using
Actions” section for details.
Opportunities and Complications. A few stat blocks
list special effects that can trigger when a character
gains an Opportunity or Complication. Adversaries
don’t roll the plot die, but they occasionally gain an
Opportunity or Complication from their d20 roll; if an
adversary gains an Opportunity or Complication, see
the “Adversary Opportunities and Compli cations”
sidebar for potential effects.
```

```
Adversary Opportunities and Complications
If an adversary rolls an Opportunity (O), you can use any
of their features or actions that allow them to spend an
Opportunity, or you can choose another effect that fits the
story. Consider the following ideas:
```

◆ (^) The adversary or their ally gains an advantage
on their next test.
◆ (^) The adversary gains 1 focus, up to their maximum.
◆ (^) The adversary doesn’t have to spend focus or
Investiture on their next action that would usually
have a cost.
◆ (^) The adversary inflicts a condition on their target until
the start of the adversary’s next turn.
◆ (^) The narrative shifts slightly in the adversary’s favor.
If an adversary rolls a Complication (C), allow the players
to suggest how that unfolds. Consider the following ideas:
◆ (^) The adversary or their ally gains a disadvantage on
their next test.
◆ (^) The adversary loses 1 focus.
◆ (^) The adversary suffers a condition until the end of
their next turn.
◆ (^) The narrative shifts slightly in the party’s favor.
Reading Stat Blocks
This section summarizes the most important things you
need to know about adversary stat blocks. In chapter
13 of the _Stormlight Handbook_ , the “Using Adversaries”
section presents complete rules for using adversary stat
blocks and building your own combat scenes.
Adversary stat blocks include some or all of the
following information:
**Title.** An adversary’s title includes helpful information
like their species, function, or other descriptors.
**Tier.** An adversary’s tier helps you choose challenging
adversaries for each scene.
**Role.** Adversaries are divided into three roles: Minion,
Rival, and Boss. Minion and Boss adversaries have
a special feature of that name in their stat blocks;
Rival adversaries follow no additional rules.
**Size.** As with PCs, an adversary’s size reflects the space
they control in combat: Small (2.5 feet), Medium
(5 feet), Large (10 feet), Huge (15 feet), and
Gargantuan (20 feet or more, at GM discretion).
**Type.** An adversary’s type doesn’t have rules associated
with it, but it describes their fundamental nature (such
as humanoid or animal). It’s up to the GM how this
interacts with the story.
**Basic Statistics.** An adversary uses the same basic
statistics as PCs. This includes the six attributes
(Strength, Speed, Intellect, Willpower, Awareness,
and Presence), three defenses (Physical, Cognitive,
and Spiritual), health, focus, and (in some cases)
Investiture.
**Deflect Value.** As with PCs, an adversary’s deflect value
reduces all incoming impact, keen, and energy damage
by the listed deflect value. If an adversary has no
deflect value listed, it is 0.
**Movement.** As with PCs, an adversary’s movement rate
determines how far they can travel during the Move
action. If an adversary has a special movement type
(such as swimming), they aren't Slowed when using it,
even if a PC usually would be.
**Senses.** As with PCs, an adversary’s senses range
determines the limit of their senses when their primary
sense is obscured. Each stat block suggests a primary
sense for each adversary, but you can change it to best
fit the story.
**Immunities.** Some adversaries are immune to certain
effects (such as conditions) when it suits the story.
**Skills.** An adversary can use any skill from chapter 3 of
the _Stormlight Handbook_ , though their stat block only
lists the skills they have ranks in.
Chapter 8: Adversaries and Bestiary **185**
RANDY VARGAS

```
Using Actions
Each stat block provides unique actions, free actions,
and/or reactions for that adversary. Adversaries can
also use the actions, free actions, and reactions listed in
chapter 10 of the Stormlight Handbook ; for example, any
adversary can (and often should) use the Move action,
the Gain Advantage action, and the Reactive Strike
reaction. Rosharan adversaries with an Investiture pool
can also use the Breathe Stormlight, Enhance, and
Regenerate actions from chapter 5 of the Stormlight
Handbook (though Fused and Regal characters breathe
Voidlight from their infused spheres, not Stormlight).
Adversary actions follow the same rules as PC actions
do, and you can’t use an action with the same name
more than once per turn.
Attacks
Most adversaries have at least one attack, which lists
the outcome of a graze (if that attack can graze) and a
hit. Unless otherwise specified, all adversary attacks are
made against the target’s Physical defense.
Damage
Actions that deal damage include two options for
determining damage: a single number followed by
parentheses with a formula for rolling dice. For example,
if an attack deals “8 (1d4 + 6) keen damage,” you can
choose to simply deal 8 damage, or you can roll a d4
then add 6 to the result.
Reactive Strikes
Adversaries can use the Reactive Strike reaction
like PCs, spending 1 focus to attack when an enemy
voluntarily leaves their reach. The adversary can make
this attack using any attack action that costs ▶ and that
lists a reach, but not one with only a range listed.
Spending Resources
If an action (or other feature) requires spending the
adversary’s focus or Investiture, this cost is noted
either in parentheses after the action name (if you
always spend it to use that action), or in the text of
the action (if other considerations affect when you
spend that resource).
```

```
Defeated Adversaries
When an adversary is reduced to 0 health,
they’re defeated.
In battle, most adversaries are assumed dead after
being reduced to 0 health. However, the GM can choose
for an important NPC to instead fall Unconscious and
make injury rolls like PCs do.
```

```
Ancestries and Abilities
Some of the stat blocks for humanoids indicate a particular
ancestry; for example, a warform singer is clearly a singer.
However, many stat blocks (such as the thief , guard , or
duelist Shardbearer ) are intended to function for any
humanoid ancestry.
Feel free to alter stat blocks to represent an adversary’s
ancestry or other unique abilities. For example, you
could represent a singer guard by borrowing some of
the warform singer’s features and actions, or even
by adapting a couple PC talents from the Stormlight
Handbook.
```

```
If the PCs are trying to defeat any adversary with
non-lethal means, the PC who deals the final blow can
choose for the NPC to fall Unconscious with an injury.
Defeated NPCs remain Unconscious until they
recover at least 1 health from another source; they
can’t voluntarily regain consciousness like a PC.

```

Ardent

```
Ardents, the priests of the Vorin church, are all trained
as religious teachers and spiritual advisors. They also
play many other roles in society, and most dedicate
themselves to becoming experts in various skills or
trades. These experts take up residence in Vorin
temples and teach citizens in accordance with the
Right to Learn.
Ardents are visually distinguished by their shaved
heads and gray robes (which don’t have safehand sleeves
for any gender). Ardents who specialize in Soulcasting,
such as the Soulcaster savant later in this chapter,
wear red robes. The curates, a council of church leaders
based in Jah Keved, wear ostentatious blue robes and
carry bejeweled staves.
See the “Vorinism” section of chapter 3 for more
details on ardents and Vorinism.
```

```
Swordmasters
Though Vorinism classifies fighting as a “masculine”
art, people who join the ardentia aren’t limited by
gender or caste, so all ardents are allowed to wield
swords. Those who choose to specialize in fighting are
known as swordmasters.
Alethkar’s battle-focused culture especially prizes
swordmasters, and it’s common for lighteyed boys to be
chosen at the age of ten for training by a swordmaster.
Swordmasters can teach their students to wield
Shardblades, doing so either with Blades dulled through
a specialized guard or with wooden practice swords
that mimic the feel of a real Blade. These ardents train
students in the ten Shardblade stances, used for both
dueling and war.
```

```
Swordmaster Ardent Tactics
A swordmaster ardent skillfully analyzes their opponents
and adjusts tactics accordingly. Against a reckless or
aggressive opponent, a swordmaster strikes decisively,
taking a slow turn to Gain Advantage and use their
Staggering Blow, then following with a fast turn to deliver
a meaningful message through Disarm Opponent. When
facing a cautious or unknown opposition, a swordmaster
gauges their opponent’s strength through attacks with
their blade, uses Parry to limit injury, and waits for an
opportune time to unleash their full force.
```

Assassin
In the intricate game of politics played across Roshar,
assassins are the cards held under the table by every
savvy player. Many important figures—from high-
ranking military officers to government officials to
royalty themselves—treat with assassins behind closed
doors. Not all their contracts are put to immediate
use, but when bureaucratic cunning and underhanded
trickery fail, an assassin can often deliver success.
A proficient assassin is adept not only at killing, but
also a half dozen other trades. Deception, forgery,
infiltration—their many skills make it easier to reach a
target then escape without notice, often by hiding in
plain sight. Some assassins are members of secret
societies, such as the Ghostbloods or the Diagram,
while others are loyal only to money.
```

```
Assassin Tactics
When surprising opponents from the shadows, an assassin
can Gain Advantage and use their Shortbow to hamstring
their target. On their next turn, they pursue the Slowed
foe, triggering Killer Instinct and following with a lethal
Dagger strike. Should an assassin fail to hit, they have no
qualms about using Twist the Knife to make up for it before
slipping into the darkness to live another day.

Axehound

```
Axehounds are a motley species, and many distinct
breeds are popular in various regions across the
Rosharan continent. Unlike many creatures on Roshar,
an axehound isn’t covered in hard carapace; they instead
sport a flexible, smooth hide of interlocking segments.
An axehound has six legs, fish-like tails, and ear holes
on the sides of their head. On both sides of their jaw,
they possess small mandibles they use to open the
shells of prey.
Axehounds communicate their mood by moving their
feathery antennae and by trumping—making a unique
call that sounds like two voices overlapping and echoing.
When content, an axehound’s trumping reverberates like
a hum, but this lowers to a bellow when they’re in pain
or enraged.
An axehound’s size is influenced by their breed.
Larger stock can reach the height of an average human
or singer’s waist; smaller breeds are often prized for their
speed. Axehounds are predators and hunt creatures as
small as cremlings and as large as hogs. In the wild, they
live in packs and hunt together. Mother axehounds are
viciously protective of their pups.

target is Medium or smaller, the axehound can spend 1 focus
to knock the target Prone, then move up to 10 feet while
dragging the target behind them.
Pack Instincts. While within 5 feet of an ally, the axehound
can use the Gain Advantage action as.
On the Hunt. After an enemy within 30 feet of the
axehound falls Prone, the axehound moves up to 15 feet
toward them.
```

```
Axehound Tactics
An axehound is rarely encountered alone, as they hunt
best with a pack. Their immediate goal is to knock an enemy
Prone with their Bite (with an advantage from Pack Instincts,
if possible), allowing other axehounds to move in for the kill
with their On the Hunt reaction. Axehounds typically swarm
a single foe rather than dispersing themselves amongst a
party, and they often drag an unwitting enemy away from
allies to more easily defeat them.
```

```
Bandit
Where there is conflict, there are those opportunistic
enough to take advantage of it. Across the countrysides
of Roshar, people stoop to banditry when making an
honest living proves too difficult—or when the cruelty
of the world simply gives them no other option.
Even with the best efforts of lawkeepers and
sharpened steel, not every winding trade route or
traveler’s road can be dutifully patrolled. Bandits stake
out these roadways between highstorms, restlessly
waiting for passing merchant caravans loaded with
valuable goods. When the opportunity to strike presents
itself, the bandits lighten these caravans and claim their
spoils through threats, violence, and even death.
Bandits typically work in small, highly skilled
groups; though larger groups prevent them from being
outnumbered by travelers, potential victims can grow
wary if a band grows too large.

Bandit Tactics
A bandit is a simple but efficient attacker. They attack
with their Shortbow from a distance, chipping away
at an unsuspecting caravanner’s health as they move
in. Once within range, the bandit charges their target
to gain Momentum, then ruthlessly debilitates them with
their Mace. After overcoming the civilians (and usually
ending their lives), the bandit makes off with their
ill-gotten gains.

Brightlord
The Vorin kingdoms practice a strict social hierarchy
and caste system, dictated largely by the lightness of a
person’s eyes (see “Vorinism” in chapter 3). To show
proper respect, a lighteyed man of sufficient rank is
addressed as Brightlord. The corresponding title for a
woman is Brightlady, or more commonly, Brightness.
Sitting at the top of an oppressive hierarchy, these
aristocrats see life as a competition—and they never

Brightlord Tactics
In battle, the brightlord is typically found flanked by spear
infantry and archers—and if they’re important enough,
occasionally a duelist Shardbearer or elite Shardbearer.
Brightlords use Influential Instruction and Inspiring
Leadership to strengthen and protect their troops, as
well as their Diversion to cut down significant threats.
When they must engage, they swiftly disarm with their
Sidesword.

Chasmfiend
Chasmfiends are the largest known land animals on
Roshar. These massive crustaceans, called “beasts
of the chasms” by the listeners, have a sprawling
width of twenty feet, a height between thirty-six and
thirty-nine feet, and a length easily over seventy feet.
Their unique anatomy makes them well suited for life
in their native Shattered Plains; with a long, narrow
body, eighteen skittering legs, and armored carapace,
a chasmfiend can navigate the chasms with ease and
weather the highstorms above. Their thick eyelids
close sideways over their green eyes, their four nostrils
are small, and their small ear holes are set slightly
behind their eyes.
These ruthless hunters can batter and carve their
unlucky prey with their foreclaws, but their gaping
maws are perhaps even more horrifying. With two
smaller foreclaws, they snatch up food and push it
into their jaw, where sharp fangs and thin mandibles
navigate food to the inner rings of teeth and the final
```

```
circular mouth. Chasmfiends are the apex predators
of the Plains, hunting any animal found in the chasms
between the plateaus. Many regard them to be the
deadliest predators on Roshar.
The enormous emerald gemheart growing inside each
chasmfiend allows them to bond with mandras—spren
related to gravity. This bond allows the chasmfiends to
reach a colossal size while preventing them from being
crushed by their own weight.
Chasmfiends establish a nest in a chasm, hunting and
scavenging from it until they ascend a plateau to pupate.
However, in this state, the hunter becomes the hunted.
While pupating, a chasmfiend can’t protect themself; the
chrysalis that forms around them isn’t enough to protect
them from people who seek gemhearts, and extracting
the gemheart kills the chasmfiend.
```

```
Economic Significance
The War of Reckoning was forever changed when the
Alethi discovered the chasmfiends’ gemhearts. Attacks
on the Parshendi risked much with little return, so

Trumpet (Costs 2 Focus). The chasmfiend unleashes
a trumpeting roar. Each character within 30 feet of them

characters who can’t hear are unaffected by this action.
Agile Blow. Before an enemy the chasmfiend can sense

within 5 feet of that enemy and uses their Claws action
against that target. On a hit, the attack resolves as usual.
On a graze, instead of the attack’s usual effects, increase
the focus cost of the target’s action by 1. The target must

The following options are available when an enemy gains
an Opportunity or Complication during a scene with the
chasmfiend:
Opportunity. An enemy can spend to prevent the chasm-
fiend from spending focus until the end of the chasmfiend’s
next turn.
Complication. The GM can spend from an enemy’s test to
have the chasmfiend use their Trumpet action as without
spending focus.
```

```
Chasmfiend Tactics
Content to feed on corpses, a chasmfiend rarely emerges
from the chasms unless baited out. Once engaged,
however, they’re a deadly hunter. They use terrain to their
advantage, backing prey into dead ends then attacking. The
chasmfiend uses Trumpet to debilitate before targeting
weak prey with their Claws and Bite. They won’t hesitate
to use Agile Blow to disorient foes who pose a threat.
```

```
the Alethi were delighted to learn that retrieving
a gemheart was far less dangerous and resulted in
great riches for the highprince who successfully
extracted it. The highprinces agreed that clashes
over the gemhearts fulfilled the Vengeance Pact,
and the war devolved into a years-long competition
for gemhearts instead.
This excessive hunting for chasmfiends has had harsh
ramifications on the chasmfiends and Roshar’s ecology,
as the chrysalises were hunted faster than the population
could recover. With their slow growth and reproduction
rate, the number of chasmfiends diminished, and the
highprinces were left to squabble over fewer and fewer
chrysalises.
```

```
Song of the Beasts
Thude, leader of the listeners who escaped the Battle of
Narak, discovered that chasmfiends possessed sapience
and the ability to communicate with singers by sharing
mental images and impressions. The listeners in the
floodplains east of the Shattered Plains now have truly
formidable allies.

Chull
Found all across Roshar, chulls are massive crustaceans,
though their many breeds vary in shape and size. A
chull has a large, porous stonelike shell which they can
retract their head and thick legs into when they sleep.
A sleeping chull resembles a boulder—a comparison
even more apt for wild chulls, as plants grow in the
cracks and crevices of their shells.
Chulls move with a lumbering gait that’s slower
than a human’s average walking pace. They sense the
space ahead of them with their whip-like antennae,
which grow at the same pace as their shell, allowing
chulls to determine whether there’s enough space
to move through upcoming terrain. Their two large
claws are strong enough to break bones, but chulls are
typically docile and aggressive behavior is extremely
unusual. Chulls aren’t very bright, but what they lack in
intelligence, they make up for in sheer stubbornness.
Though domesticated chulls are typically fed grain,
they’re actually omnivores. In the wild, their diet
includes both rockbuds and small creatures like crabs
and slugs.

to defend themself until the start of their next turn. While

can use the Brace action as if they were in cover. At the start
of each of their turns, the chull can spend 1 focus to maintain
this effect for an additional round.
```

```
Cultural Influence
Chulls are valuable work animals. Despite their slow
speed, they’re strong enough to pull wagons, carts,
and other large wheeled machinery. A chull’s shell isn’t
made of living material, and it can be damaged—or
intentionally modified—without harming the chull.
Chull shells are also valued as a lightweight but
durable crafting material. Chull meat is edible and
can be dried to create jerky.
```

```
Chull Tactics
Immensely docile, a chull almost always retreats into their
shell with their Defense Curl during combat. However,
once pushed to the brink, they use their large claws to
defend themselves; a pinch from a chull hurts.

Citizen
The people of Roshar come from diverse cultural
backgrounds, and each person has their own hopes,
dreams, and capabilities. Most ordinary citizens strive
to avoid violence, protect their loved ones, and pursue
whatever prosperity they can find.
Commoners are the typical citizens found in any
nation across Roshar. A farmer, baker, weaver, scribe,
or any other person who leads a simple life might be
a commoner.
An expert, whether they’re found in a major city or
a remote village, is someone who stands out from the
crowd. An expert might be a local leader, a headstrong
youth, or a savvy trader. More competent than the
average person, experts are memorable citizens with
strong convictions.
Of high birth or circumstance, socialites ooze wealth
and influence wherever they go. Typically hailing from
a prominent family or organization, they’ve learned to
wield words and politics as adeptly as weapons. While
some of a socialite’s dealings may seem frivolous and
unimportant, their motives are as esoteric and biting
as their shifting loyalties.

```
Citizen Tactics
In combat, citizens generally flee and seek safety unless
their loved ones are in immediate danger.
When forced to fight, a commoner resorts to an
Improvised Weapon, or they might Distract to aid a more
capable ally. In conversations, they usually concede to
those they consider more competent.
An expert usually fights cautiously with their Improvised
Weapon, but unlike most commoners, they might run
straight into danger if they believe in a cause or see a
chance for glory. In conversations, they’re more likely than
commoners to stand their ground. If a PC challenges an
expert’s beliefs, the expert is more likely to spend focus to
resist influence. If sufficiently provoked, they may use their
Counter Argument and Stern Countenance to make things
difficult for their opponent.
A socialite shines in conversations, where their
Charming Personality allows them to maintain power
and composure while shattering their opponent’s. Their
Down the Grapevine reaction gains them further leverage.
Socialites are unlikely to engage in combat unless forced,
and they prioritize fleeing to safety unless there’s no other
option. When cornered, they use their Beguiling Influence
and Distracting Countenance to weaken foes for stronger
allies, leaning on their Knife as a last resort.

```
Cremling Swarm
The term cremling collectively refers to many species
of tiny scavenger crustaceans. They vary heavily in
appearance, including different colors, tail shapes, claw
sizes, and antennae lengths, though most have elongated
bodies and many legs.
Some cremlings are scavengers who feed on the
blood and flesh of deceased creatures, while others
are herbivores who feed on vegetation in the wake of a
highstorm, when Rosharan flora reveal their vulnerable
inner matter. Some cremling types include both in
their diets.
While some cremlings are venomous, most species
are relatively harmless unless they gather into a sizable
swarm. However, a cremling swarm—or even a single
cremling by itself—may not be all it seems, as described
in the Sleepless profile.
Across Roshar, cremlings are considered and
dis missed as irritating pests. The word is a common
Rosharan insult and often used to describe cow-
ardly behavior.
```

```
Cremling Swarm Tactics
A cremling swarm uses its Screech while within range
of as many enemies as possible. After that, it uses Bite,
dealing as much damage as possible before the swarm is
thinned out. Once reduced below half its starting health,
the swarm attempts to attack with greater precision by
using Gain Advantage with Agility.

Criminal
At their best, laws create order and support the
community, but some people are always willing to break
them. In the shadows of Roshar’s urban centers lurk
many common criminals—petty thieves, charming con
artists, cold-blooded murderers—and those who lead
them. While some ply their trade in broad daylight,
others keep to dubious markets and disreputable dens
for gambling, wrestling, or firemoss.
Keen-eyed crooks can easily spot a person out of

people passing through unfamiliar territory.

Methodology
A petty thief might bump into their chosen mark in a

opportunity is ripe, ready with a silver tongue to charm

Dustbringer
The Order of Dustbringers numbers among the Knights
Radiant. They form a Nahel bond with ashspren and
are Surgebinders with access to the surges of Division
and Abrasion.
Historically, the Dustbringers disliked the name of
their order due to its similarity to the term Voidbringers.
They preferred to be called Releasers. Because of the
ruinous nature of their surges, the Dustbringers were
frequently considered dangerous by both the public and
other Radiants—especially the Skybreakers.
The Dustbringer order and its oaths focused on
controlling their destructive power. Within the Knights
Radiant, they often served as sappers, strategists, and
engineers. After the refounding of the Radiants, the
Dustbringers are fickle with their loyalty. Some have
chosen to work against Dalinar’s coalition, and even
those who ostensibly work within it are disobedient
and rebellious.

Improvising Radiant Adversaries
Under rare circumstances, PCs might engage in combat
with members of the Knights Radiant, possibly motivated
by conflicting Ideals, goals, or external interference. This
chapter provides adversary profiles for Skybreakers and
Dustbringers—two of the orders of Knights Radiant that
PCs are most likely to clash with.
You can improvise Radiant adversaries from other

Choose Stat Block. Choose a humanoid stat block.
Choose Radiant Order. Choose a Radiant order (detailed
in chapter 5 of the Stormlight Handbook ). Add both of
that order’s surge skills to the stat block, giving both
skills a number of ranks equal to the stat block’s tier.
Add Investiture. Add an Investiture score of 2 + either
their Awareness or Presence.
Choose Surge Talents. Using the Radiant talents and
surge talents available to PCs in chapters 5 and 6 of
the Stormlight Handbook , give the adversary a number
of talents equal to their Ideal. When you choose these
talents, keep an eye out for skill prerequisites, but
ignore talent prerequisites.
Now you have a Radiant adversary! While you don’t need
to adjust the stat block’s tier, be aware adding these
Surgebinding abilities does increase an adversary’s power.
When using Radiants as adversaries, consider how their
Ideals might alter their tactics. If a Radiant acts in blatant
disregard of their oaths, their bond with their spren and
their access to the surges are negatively affected.

```
Surgebinding
Through the surge of Division, Dustbringers can cause
objects—or living flesh—to burn, degrade, or turn
to dust. Their precise control over this surge enables
them both to cause sweeping destruction and to carve
a surface with intricate detail.
The surge of Abrasion allows Dustbringers to alter
the friction between two surfaces. They can use this
surge to move unimpeded through water and other
difficult terrain.
Together, these surges grant tremendous mobility
and destructive power. On the battlefield, Dustbringers
often serve as formidable sappers and mobile artillery. In
more peaceful times, however, they often incline toward
engineering and other pursuits that emphasize precision
and attention to detail.
```

```
Dustbringer Tactics
A Dustbringer of the Second Ideal carves a destructive
path in and out of melee with their foes. They Skate to close
the distance, attack with their Sidesword, then disengage.
Burst of Flame is their primary tactic for groups of enemies,
and Decaying Touch saps the strength of their bulkier foes.
Ultimately, the Dustbringer devastates an area and is hard
to pin down—and their Eroding Escape ensures that.
After they swear their next oath, a Dustbringer of the
Third Ideal becomes stronger and better at Surgebinding,
and they can wield a Shardblade.
Becoming a full Knight Radiant by swearing another
Ideal, a Dustbringer of the Fourth Ideal is even more pow-
erful and proficient with surgebinding, and has a swarm of
gravitationspren they can summon as Shardplate.

Altered One
Also known as the fannahn-im—Dawnchant for Those
Ones of Alteration—Altered Ones are the brand of
Fused who wield the surge of Transformation.
Even among singers, an Altered One is strikingly
statuesque, standing seven feet tall with a willowy
stature and long, thin fingers. Crown-like carapace
covers most of their skull, with hairstrands growing
at the very top of their head. They have additional
armor-like carapace segments across their chest,
forearms, and shins.
Throughout their long lifetimes, the Altered Ones
have become experts in the fields of engineering,
science, and architecture. They’re regarded as great
builders and, during the era of the True Desolation,
they comprehensively redesigned the palace in
Kholinar after it was captured by Odium’s forces.
A notable Altered One was Raboniel, the Lady of
Wishes (once known as the Lady of Pains), a brilliant
scholar and high-ranking Fused. During the last
Return, she engineered a disease that decimated the
human population and also spread to some singers.
```

```
Abilities
Altered Ones can use the surge of Transformation in
all the same ways a Radiant can, transforming any
substance into another. However, due to mastery honed
over millennia, they can achieve complex essences
far beyond a mortal Radiant’s capabilities, like toxins
and acids.
While Altered Ones must expend Voidlight to
use this surge on things around them, they can
inexhaustibly transform any substances that are at
least partially within their own bodies, such as by
turning weapons that hit them to dust or transfiguring
their breath into a toxic gas before exhaling it onto
unsuspecting foes. Altered Ones also have exceptional
spatial reasoning, which they have sharpened through
millennia of practicing architecture and artifice, and
they wield their surge as formidable tacticians.
```

```
Fused
The Fused are the souls of ancient singers who usurp
the bodies of living singers to roam Roshar during
Desolations. The nine brands of Fused each can access
one surge. They’re able to heal themselves with Voidlight
(much like how Knights Radiant heal themselves with
Stormlight), making them mighty opponents.
Though a Fused’s host body can be slain through
typical means, their soul can return to claim another
host during the next Everstorm. They do so by taking
over a willing singer who has opened their gemheart
to bond a spren. Permanently defeating a Fused’s
soul requires weapons or other means fit to end or
entrap an immortal being, such as the sword known as
Nightblood. (To learn about the origins of the Fused,
see “Listener Gods: The Fused” in chapter 3.)

DC 18 Deduction test. On a success, they grant the Focused
condition to one ally they can influence within 30 feet of

```
Surge of Transformation (Costs 2 Investiture). The
Altered One chooses a Huge (15-foot) or smaller area or
object within 30 feet of them that isn’t being worn or held,
transforming that area or object’s essence into another.
For example, they might transform empty air into stone or
a wooden door into water.
Depending on the nature of the transformation, this can
cause an effect such as dealing damage to characters in that
area or making them Restrained. Each character in that area
must make a DC 16 Agility or Athletics test. On a failure, a
character takes 22 (4d10) damage of a type appropriate to
the essence (such as vital for poison or energy for fire), or
they otherwise suffer an effect that fits the transformation.
On a success, a character only takes 11 (2d10) damage if the
effect can deal damage, or they otherwise suffer no effect.
Regenerate (Costs 1 Investiture). The Altered One
recovers 6 (1d6 + 3) health. They can use this free action
even while Unconscious or otherwise prevented from

Demolish Weapon. After the Altered One is hit or
grazed by a non-Invested weapon, they can turn that
weapon to smoke.
opportunities and complications

Opportunity. An enemy can spend to prevent the
Altered One from using their Tactical Insight, Surge of
Transformation, and Regenerate actions until the end of
the Altered One’s next turn.
Complication. The GM can spend from an enemy’s test
to have the Altered One use their Surge of Transformation
action as. Each target gains a disadvantage on their
Agility or Athletics test against that action’s effect.
```

```
Altered One Tactics
An Altered One supports other forces on the field of
battle by hindering foes. This Fused can break weapons
with Demolish Weapon, warp the battlefield with Surge of
Transformation, and disorient warriors with Exhale Toxins.
They frequently use their Tactical Insight to bolster allies,
and when they need to wade into the battle themselves,
they use their Knife for a burst of damage.

```
Deepest One
Also known as the makay-im—Dawnchant for Those
Ones of the Depths—Deepest Ones are the brand of
Fused who manipulate the surge of Cohesion.
A Deepest One has smooth skin and entirely lacks
hairstrands. Their minimal carapace covers only their
genitals and their head. They have a sinuous form with
long limbs, though they’re not abnormally tall, and their
eerie white eyes glow red from behind.
Deepest Ones enjoy gliding through uncut stone to
feel the heart of Roshar through the earth. When idle,
they spend their time sunken into the ground with only
their faces exposed.
```

```
Abilities
In addition to wielding Cohesion like a Radiant,
Deepest Ones can use Voidlight to soften and shape
earth and stone around them, melding their bodies with
it and flowing seamlessly through it with an unnatural
grace. They can fully immerse their entire body or only
parts of it, but they can’t immerse objects that aren’t
naturally part of them. Deepest Ones vastly prefer
merging with stone, though they can merge with
almost any solid substance; notably, they
can’t merge with wood, so wooden
walkways serve as an effective defense
against their ambushes.
These Fused can partially emerge
from whatever surface they have
merged into, allowing them to entrap,
shove, or trip foes using their arms and
legs without exposing their full body to
attack. Such abilities make the Deepest
Ones quite useful as surprise troops—
ambushing foes by emerging from solid
stone without warning and dispatching
them before any can raise an alarm.
However, they aren’t as capable in
direct combat as other brands of Fused.
Deepest Ones can’t see while
submerged in a solid substance.
However, they can hear and sing, and
thus are guided through their temporary
blindness by the pure tones of Roshar.
```

```
Deepest One Tactics
A Deepest One is an eerie foe, unsettling and ruthless.
They freely move within solid surfaces, striking with
their Carapace Nails or Trip Attack while maintaining
their protection. They can reshape the battlefield with
their Surge of Cohesion, hinder foes with Entrap, or drag
a single enemy down to suffocate with their Grasping
Hands—especially one they already knocked prone
with Trip Attack.

As , the Restrained target can make a DC 17 Agility
test, removing the Restrained condition on a success. If the
Deepest One takes at least 20 damage on a single turn,
the target escapes and is no longer Restrained.
Surge of Cohesion (Costs 1 Investiture). The Deepest
One chooses a Large (10-foot) or smaller area or object
within 30 feet of them that is made of stone or earth and
that isn’t being worn or held. That object or area changes
shape in a manner they choose, though not violently enough
to cause damage.
Depending on the nature of the reshaping, this can cause
an effect such as creating or removing cover or difficult
terrain, or applying the Restrained condition to characters in
that area. If the effect would apply a condition, a character
can avoid it with a successful DC 15 Agility or Athletics test.
Regenerate (Costs 1 Investiture). The Deepest One
recovers 5 (1d6 + 2) health. They can use this free action
even while Unconscious or otherwise prevented from

Entrap. When an enemy triggers a Reactive Strike from
the Deepest One while the Deepest One is submerged, the
Deepest One can instead use their Grasping Hands as ,
spending focus as if they made a Reactive Strike.

Complication. The GM can spend from an enemy’s test to

Devastating One
Also known as the tatak-im—Dawnchant for Those
Ones of Devastation—Devastating Ones are the brand
of Fused who unleash the surge of Division.
A Devastating One’s most distinctive feature is their
carapace horns, of which they can have two or more;
these are usually symmetrical, beginning just above their
eyes and curving out over their head, with a smaller
spike growing back from each cheekbone. The moderate
carapace on their chest, shins, forearms, and shoulders
is covered in jagged spikes, and their fingers are tipped
with carapace claws. A Devastating One grows their
hairstrands in wild spikes that extend from the top and
back of their scalp.
Devastating Ones usually stoop in aggressive, eager
postures, and some maneuver using both their hands
and feet. Capricious and volatile, Devastating Ones
rarely deign to speak or socialize with others, and when
they do, they tend toward monosyllabism.
In battle, Devastating Ones serve as a chaotic
demolition crew. Entering a euphoric frenzy in
anticipation of the pain and havoc they can wreak,
they charge in with no concern for their safety or
any greater strategy. They seek only to cause as much
```

```
destruction and death as possible before they’re killed,
and they can leave entire settlements decimated if
unchecked. However, their lack of caution belies the
fierce intellect they instinctively use to effectively bring
down enemies and destroy structures.
Abilities
In addition to harnessing the surge of Division in many
of the same ways as a Radiant, turning large swaths of
structures and terrain to dust, a Devastating One’s body
is anathema to physical objects. They can will their skin
and carapace to disintegrate anything they touch, from
the weapons of their foes to the very ground beneath
their feet. Devastating Ones delight in leaving a trail
of ash and dust in their wake.

Surge of Division (Costs 2 Investiture). The Devastating
One chooses a Large (10-foot) object within 30 feet of them
that isn’t being worn or held, or a portion of such an object,
destroying it in a manner of their choosing.
Depending on the nature of the destruction, this can cause
an effect such as obscuring the area with dust, opening a
passage in a wall, triggering a rockslide that deals damage or
applies the Restrained condition, or electrifying the area with
a blast of light and heat that applies the Disoriented condi-
tion. Each character potentially affected by that destruction
must make a DC 15 Agility or Athletics test. On a failure, a

weapon to dust.
opportunities and complications
The following options are available when an enemy gains
an Opportunity or Complication during a scene with the
Devastating One:
Opportunity. An enemy can spend to disable the
Devastating One’s Shroud of Dust feature and prevent
them from using their Surge of Division and Regenerate
actions until the end of the Devastating One’s next turn.
Complication. The GM can spend from an enemy’s test
to have the Devastating One use either their Claws or
Devastating Touch action as. When they do, they gain
an advantage on that attack test.
```

```
Devastating One Tactics
A Devastating One charges into battle with reckless
abandon, often ignoring direct opposition if a nearby
target holds greater potential for death and destruction.
They tear into enemies with their Claws and Devastating
Touch. If nearby structures shelter several characters,
the Devastating One uses their Surge of Division to
collapse the structure on their foes—even if allies of
the Devastating One are also within that structure.

Flowing One
Also known as the shetel-im—Dawnchant for Those
Ones of Flowing—Flowing Ones are the brand of Fused
who use the surge of Abrasion.
Lithe and flexible, a Flowing One has some of
the sleekest and most minimal carapace of all Fused
brands, covering only their forehead, upper chest, groin,
forearms, and shins. Their carapace is heaviest on the
outer portions of their limbs. Flowing One hairstrands
grow thickly from the top, back, and sides of their head.
They typically wear their hairstrands braided in a long
tail or several cords, and at the end of each, they weave
in a metal spike. Though these spikes are primarily
decorative, they serve as weapons in a pinch.
Flowing Ones serve Odium as special forces, and
can even serve much like cavalry, using their incredible
agility and speed to slip through battlefields. They’re
especially adept at flanking, usually targeting
ranged units or using their raysium daggers to
drain Stormlight from Radiants. The name
Flowing One comes from their fighting
style, which resembles a dance as they
slide along the ground with flowing
movements and precise strikes.
```

```
Abilities
Through Abrasion, a Flowing One can constantly
manipulate their body’s friction, either becoming slick
and nearly impossible to pin down, or gaining additional
grip and leverage on treacherous surfaces. They often
use this power to climb slippery surfaces or skate along
the ground while effortlessly deflecting enemy blows.
Flowing Ones can also use the surge like a Radiant
can, affecting objects beyond their own bodies, though
this requires them to expend their Voidlight.

Flowing One Tactics
A Flowing One is an adroit opponent who swiftly
manipulates friction on the battlefield while vexing foes
with their Surge of Abrasion. They use Mobile to split
their movement, racing across the battlefield to knock
opponents prone with Coarse Grip and making multiple
attacks with their Raysium Dagger and Twin Daggers. They
escape trouble with Deft Dodge and they Skate to put
distance between them and threatening foes.
```

```
Chapter 8: Adversaries and Bestiary 211
```

```
Focused One Tactics
A Focused One is almost always accompanied by at least
four singer guards or Regals (likely stormform Regals ).
As such, this Fused is content to wait for their enemy to
approach while attacking from afar with Launch Boulder.
Once the enemy draws close enough to engage, the
Focused One dominates by using Tight Form followed
by either their Tense Spear or Whip. If faced with a
particularly troublesome foe, the Focused One uses
the Grapple action and their brutal Decompress Grip.
However, doing so leaves the Focused One temporarily
vulnerable, so they tend only to do this when they can
isolate the enemy.
```

```
Focused One
Also known as the metacha-im—Dawnchant for Those
Ones of Focus—Focused Ones are the brand of Fused
who manipulate the surge of Tension.
Focused Ones are among the tallest and broadest of
the Fused, with stout bodies molded through practiced
indulgence. They have no carapace, allowing them
full heads of hairstrands, and they utilize skin’s elastic
nature to cultivate a thick layer of fat throughout
their bodies, obscuring their powerful musculature.
A Focused One can use Tension to compact themself
down to the size of a workform, creating armor-like skin
that glows purple with Voidlight.
In addition to clothing that accommodates both of
their sizes, Focused Ones generally wear a long necklace
folded several times over their torso. This necklace is
made of their own hair bound with aluminum links,
and it culminates in a blade. When in close combat,
this necklace can serve as both weapon and restraint;
the Focused One uses it as a whip that can be wrapped
around a target and stiffened with Tension to trap
them, or straightened and made rigid for use as a
powerful spear.
Focused Ones serve Odium as field commanders
and taskmasters, and they typically travel on palanquins
carried by warform and Regal guards. They can com-
mand and coordinate troops or laborers, but they’re
also sometimes stationed with their retinues at strategic
points their enemy is likely to target.
```

```
Abilities
Focused Ones use Tension in many of the same ways
as Radiants, making cloth and other soft materials even
more stiff and durable than steel. However, they can also
use it to drastically tighten their bodies into wiry and
banded forms. These compact Voidlight-infused layers
of skin, fat, and muscle are much harder than carapace,
causing most attacks to glance harmlessly off them—
even those from powerful weapons like Shardblades.
This form also greatly increases a Focused One’s
mobility, enabling them to instantaneously
decompress parts of their body to lethal
effect, creating enough force to launch
boulders and crush foes in their grip.

Heavenly One
Also known as the shanay-im—Dawnchant for Those
Ones of the Heavens—Heavenly Ones are the brand of
Fused who manipulate the surge of Gravitation.
Heavenly Ones enjoy wearing long, trailing robes,
and even when idle, they prefer to fly or hover. Many of
these Fused have an honorable tradition of engaging in
one-on-one duels with Windrunners. If such a duel is
accepted, other Heavenly Ones respect the terms and
won’t interfere, even if one of their own is losing.
A notable Heavenly One is Leshwi, who was once
friends with an honorspren prior to the Desolations. She
frequently dueled Kaladin Stormblessed, demonstrating
ruthlessness but also a sense of honor. Leshwi also
played a role in recruiting Moash as an agent of Odium.
```

```
Abilities
Through the surge of Gravitation, Heavenly Ones
can manipulate their own gravity without expending
Voidlight. However, they’re limited to a single Lashing
when flying this way, causing them to accelerate more
slowly than Radiant Surgebinders. Otherwise, Heavenly
Ones create Basic Lashings in a similar manner to
Radiants, using Voidlight to adjust the gravity of other
characters and objects.
They wield long lances coated with aluminum (to
block Shardblades) and inset with raysium (to drain
Stormlight from Radiants). Within Odium’s forces, the
Heavenly Ones are aerial soldiers who not only harry
ground troops from above, but also actively counter
Knights Radiant who wield the surge of Gravitation.

To Lash an enemy, the Heavenly One makes a Gravitation
test against the enemy’s Physical defense. On a success,
they move the target up to 30 feet in any direction, and the
target becomes Restrained until the start of the Heavenly
One’s next turn. If the target passes within reach of an object,
they can make a DC 16 Agility test, grabbing the object and
stopping this forced movement on a success.

Husked One
Also known as the nex-im—Dawnchant for Those Ones
of Husks—the Husked Ones are rare Fused who use the
surge of Transportation on their own bodies.
A Husked One is large-framed, with thick muscles
and weighty, jagged carapace across their body that
grows in fin- and horn-like shapes. They can grow
hair long enough to wrap around their body in place
of clothing.
A notable Husked One was Lezian, known as the
Pursuer. As the first Fused to be killed by a human,
Lezian sought to bury his shame by starting a tradition:
he would return to Roshar and single-mindedly pursue
whichever human killed him. He succeeded every
Desolation. Other Fused encouraged his notorious
behavior, even though his recklessness had previously
endangered or ruined others’ schemes.
```

```
Abilities
Through the surge of Transportation, a Husked One
can eject their soul from their body, turning their soul
into a ribbon of red light which resembles a spren.
Unlike most other brands of Fused, this is the only
way Husked Ones can use their surge, rather than
wielding it as Radiants do.
When a Husked One ejects from their body, they
can’t take anything with them, and they leave behind
a faded husk that crumbles to dust after a few moments.
The Husked One can use Voidlight to reform their body,
though they can only hold enough Voidlight to do so
three times. After the third jump, a Husked One with-
out access to Voidlight is trapped in their fourth body,
vulnerable to a killing blow. This leads most Husked
Ones to use their last jump to find a Voidlight repository
so they can recharge.
The Husked Ones are skilled hit-and-run
skirmishers, able to free themselves from precarious
situations, flee in an instant when a battle turns against
them, or deftly maneuver around an opponent in the
midst of battle. Each time a Husked One reforms their
body, their carapace is also restored, so they often break
off the sharper pieces to use as weapons.
```

```
Husked One Tactics
A Husked One is a slippery foe. They begin combat with
Chokehold to lock down a threat, but when the fight
catches up with them, they have multiple ways to escape,
using either a Carapace Spike attack to slip away or an
Impairing Blow to hamstring their opponent. They can
quickly flee or chase down enemies with Escape Husk—
and if it’s the latter, they use Reform Body then follow
with a ruthless Assassinate to crush the opposition.

Magnified One
Also known as the yazed-im—Dawnchant for Those
Ones of Magnification—Magnified Ones are the brand
of Fused who wield the surge of Progression.
Even the most diminutive Magnified Ones are large
and broad-shouldered compared to other Fused, and
the tallest humans are at least a head shorter than them.
Much like the plate armor of humans, a Magnified
One’s thick, extensive carapace encases everything but
their face, emphasizing their heavy musculature. The
carapace on their shoulders, back, and head is covered in
spikes. Magnified Ones typically don’t have hairstrands,
though some grow beards.
These Fused serve Odium as heavy infantry, and they
can even act as living siege weapons, breaking through
lines and battlements with ease. However, Magnified
Ones are far from brutish combatants; they often use
Progression tactically by growing carapace that traps
opponents or counters equipment, rather than relying
only on sheer strength and bulk.
```

```
Abilities
Through the surge of Progression, a Magnified One
can deliberately grow their own carapace with swift
precision without exhausting their Voidlight. This allows
them to form natural weapons—and even mundane
objects, such as tools—as extensions of their own body.
The edges of these weapons are wickedly sharp
and jagged, often glowing purple with Voidlight.
In addition, a Magnified One can reinforce their
carapace to counter incoming blows or grow
it to surround and entrap enemies,
then snap off that section of shell to
avoid being bound to it.
Unlike Radiants who wield
Progression, Magnified Ones
can’t use the surge to heal others
or grow plants; they can only use it
on their own bodies.
```

```
Magnified One Tactics
A Magnified One is a clever and tactical foe who can
respond flexibly in combat. When enemies are grouped
up, they begin with a Magnified Charge to devastate the
area, then strike with their Carapace Weapon. They create
Carapace Spikes to wound foes in melee, and their Surge
of Progression erects obstacles to hamper enemies who
retreat or call for reinforcements. When the tide begins
to turn, the Magnified One fights more defensively, using
External Carapace, avoiding grazes with their Carapace
Armor, and using Regenerate to heal wounds and injuries.

Grow Carapace (Costs 1 Investiture). The Magnified
One grows their carapace for additional armor or spikes,
gaining the corresponding benefit:
Carapace Armor. The Magnified One can’t be grazed until
the end of their next turn.
Carapace Spikes. Until the end of the Magnified One’s next
turn, the first time each turn that a character either hits
the Magnified One with a melee attack or successfully
Grapples or Shoves the Magnified One, that character
takes 11 (2d10) keen damage.
Magnified Charge (Costs 2 Focus). The Magnified One
moves up to 25 feet in a straight line without triggering
Reactive Strikes. The first time the Magnified One comes
within 5 feet of each enemy during this move, the Magnified
One can make a Carapace Weapon attack against that
enemy as ▷. On a hit, the enemy is also knocked Prone.
Surge of Progression (Costs 2 Investiture). The
Magnified One chooses a Huge (15-foot) or smaller area
within 30 feet of them, growing their carapace with incredi-
ble speed in a way they choose, though not violently enough
to cause damage.
Depending on the nature of the carapace construction,
this can cause an effect such as the creation of cover, difficult
terrain, or a structure, or it can cause characters in that area
to become Immobilized. If the effect would apply a condition
to a character, they can avoid it with a successful DC 16 Agility
or Athletics test.
Regenerate (Costs 1 Investiture). The Magnified One
recovers 15 (1d10 + 10) health and recovers from up to one
injury of their choice. They can use this free action even while
Unconscious or otherwise prevented from using actions.
opportunities and complications
The following options are available when an enemy gains
an Opportunity or Complication during a scene with the
Magnified One:
Opportunity. An enemy can spend to prevent the
Magnified One from using any actions that cost Investiture
until the end of the Magnified One’s next turn.
Complication. The GM can spend from an enemy’s test
to have the Magnified One use their Grow Carapace
action as.

Masked One
Also known as the mavset-im—Dawnchant for Those
Ones of Masks—Masked Ones are the brand of Fused
who use the surge of Illumination.
Masked Ones are perhaps the most unsettling of
all the Fused, even to other brands. They constantly
keep themselves cloaked in illusions. In the exceedingly
rare moments in which a Masked One’s guise drops—
typically when they’ve been killed—their true form is
revealed to be of a similar size and shape to humans,
though hairless and with a subdermal carapace covering
their whole body, giving parts of their skin a slightly
ridged appearance.
Some Masked Ones use their illusions to unnerve
others, either by completely removing their marbled
skin patterns or making the patterns constantly
shift—either way, this can make it nearly impossible
to tell them apart from other Masked Ones. When
not fully disguised, most Masked Ones garb
themselves in elaborate and fanciful illusions that are
limited only by their prodigious creativity. These usually
include flowing fabrics that billow in a phantom breeze,
skin patterns that move subtly, and rounded armor-like
carapace that is black or white (rather than the natural
orange- or violet-red).
The Masked Ones serve Odium as spies, assassins,
and covert operatives, using their mastery of illusions to
be mercurial chameleons. They are rarely, if ever, seen
on the battlefield. Instead, they sow dissent, sabotage
equipment, and spread false information to destabilize
command structures and throw their enemy into chaos.
Within Fused-occupied areas, they function as secret
police, monitoring the singer and human populations
for compliance.
```

```
Abilities
Through the surge of Illumination, the Masked Ones
can imitate the appearances of other creatures. Their
millennia of experience in clandestine activities make
them master impersonators, allowing them to near-
perfectly mimic any person they wish. They can use
this surge in nearly all the same ways as Radiants, but
the guises they assume require no Voidlight whatsoever,
lasting until the Masked One is slain or chooses to
end the illusion.
```

```
Masked One Tactics
A Masked One is a clever infiltrator who uses Illusory
Disguise, Infiltrator, and Surge of Illumination to position
themselves to deftly assassinate targets. They rattle
an enemy with Cunning Tongue, then use their Staff to
hamper their target’s escape.

Surge of Illumination (Costs 1 Investiture). The Masked
One chooses a Large (10-foot) or smaller area or willing

Ghostblood
The Ghostbloods are a secret organization; though they
operate a cell on Roshar, they originate from the planet
Scadrial and are dedicated to protecting their home (see
“Ghostbloods” in chapter 5). To become a member, one
must be recruited by another Ghostblood. Upon joining,
each member receives an identifying tattoo of three
overlapping diamonds somewhere on their body.
The organization operates within a rigid structure of
command and follows firm tenets. Ghostbloods freely
share secrets with each other but are forbidden to do
so with outsiders, and those who break this trust are
at risk of being hunted and killed for endangering the
organization.
In pursuit of their primary goal—defending Scadrial
at all costs—the Ghostbloods have no qualms about
killing those who could interfere with them. They work
```

```
flexibly with or against various people and factions on
Roshar, depending on what best aligns with their needs.
The Rosharan branch of the Ghostbloods is
somewhat removed from the greater body, and their
Scadrian associates view their actions as erratic.
```

```
Capabilities and Resources
Ghostbloods are skilled infiltrators with experience in
subterfuge, sabotage, and assassination. Even those
who aren’t native to Roshar can seamlessly adapt their
appearance and behaviors to blend in with Rosharan
cultures and institutions.
As many of their members are cosmere-aware
worldhoppers, the Ghostbloods have access to valuable
technology and resources from other planets. Given
Roshar’s lack of cosmere-awareness, the Ghostbloods
use these enigmatic resources to gain the upper hand
over the planet’s inhabitants.

Guard
Guards serve as the backbone of defense for centers of
civilization and persons of power throughout Roshar. In
a city, a disciplined and well-trained guard force can be
the difference between order and anarchy. For a person
they protect, they can be the difference between life
and death.
Small towns only have a few guards, if any, and those
who do serve are often from a volunteer militia. Major
cities employ sizable guard forces, including organized
units who patrol the streets, along with dedicated
guard postings for notable locations like prisons and
treasuries. Palaces and other important government
buildings sometimes maintain their own specialized
and independent guard forces.
Some nobles hire personal guards to defend their
estates. Important political and military figures,
especially royalty, have honor guards trained for
their personal protection.
```

```
Guard Tactics
A guard quickly incapacitates their targets, especially
those discovered committing a crime. They aim to knock
an opponent prone with their Longspear, then use Debil-
itate to inflict significant damage. While accompanied by
other guards or allies, a guard uses Work as One, quickly
and efficiently coordinating to subdue opponents.

Khornak
Lurking in shallow coastal waters, khornaks are brutal
hunters who thrive in packs—but even one can be
frightening on their own. They have thick, webbed
limbs protected by chunks of carapace, along with eight
beady eyes, a jagged tail, and a toothy maw that sailors
wisely fear.
The khornaks’ bond with spren allows their hefty
frames to skim through the water in search of prey,
barely disturbing the surface despite their thick
carapace jutting out. A khornak is most dangerous
in close range, where they unveil a massive jaw lined
with many rows of jagged teeth—perfect
for gouging prey, latching
onto skin, and dragging
victims into the water
where the khornak pack
can descend. Should
a khornak not have a pack,
that matters little—they
simply drown you.

Khornak Tactics
A dangerous and deadly foe, a khornak first ensnares and

Larkin
Also known as Ancient Guardians or Guardians of
Ancient Sins, larkin are crustaceans native to Aimia who
are capable of flight—as well as of eating Stormlight. As
an endangered species, they are highly valued, and their
corpses sell for fortunes.
A juvenile larkin is around the size of a small melon
and possesses a snout, a mouth, and silver eyes that
shimmer. Their wings can fold in and out of their back
and carry them short distances. They can understand
and somewhat replicate human languages, as well as
hear rhythms.
Like greatshells, larkin used to bond with spren—
in this case, a large kind of luckspren found in Aimia—
to grow to great sizes. After the scouring of Aimia,
however, larkin haven’t been able to migrate there
to create the bonds, so the handful who exist across
Roshar retain their small size.
```

```
Stormlight Feast
Larkin can pull Stormlight out of Surgebinders,
Shardplate and gems. They can also drain Voidlight
from a Fused. However, larkin can’t drain someone clad
in Shardplate, only the Light from the Shardplate itself.
Additionally, they can’t return Light once it’s been
sucked from its source, as they feed on the Investiture
they’ve drawn.
There are several reasons to believe that larkin are
associated with the Knights Radiant. Not only do they
feed on Investiture, but Surgebinders can also sense a
larkin’s mood. The exact specifics of this relationship
remain a mystery, but there is perhaps some historical
connection.

Drain Light. If the larkin isn’t at full Investiture, they
choose one of the following targets within 5 feet of them,
draining the chosen target of power:
```

◆ (^) **Object with Charges.** A fabrial or other object with
charges loses 2 (1d4) charges.
◆ (^) **Group of Spheres.** Up to 2 (1d4) infused marks or

◆ (^) **Infused Object or Character.** The target (or effect

by a character, the larkin must succeed on an Agility test
against that character’s Spiritual defense or the target

The larkin regains the same amount of Investiture as
they drained from the target. A character wearing Invested
Shardplate can’t have their Investiture drained in this way,

Invested Enhancement (Costs 1 Investiture). The larkin
becomes Enhanced [Strength +1] and Enhanced [Speed +1]

If the target is a character, or if it is an object worn or held by
a character, the larkin must succeed on an Agility test against
that character’s Spiritual defense or the target isn’t drained.
The larkin regains the same amount of Investiture as
they drained from the target. A character wearing Invested
Shardplate can’t have their Investiture drained in this way,
but the Shardplate itself can be drained of charges.
**Invested Healing.** The larkin can spend 1 Investiture
to recover 7 (1d6 + 4) health.

A **larkin** is more mischievous than violent by nature. They
have a near-constant hunger for Stormlight and other
Investiture, flitting around and using Drain Light on the
nearest viable target.
Larkin are fiercely loyal, and if incensed by a character
or directed by an ally, a larkin can target equipment or
Investiture reserves with their Bite and Drain Light. They
can use this drained power to heal themselves with Invested
Healing, and the **greater larkin** can also use Invested
Enhancement against more dangerous foes.

Midnight Essence
On Roshar, Midnight Essence is associated with one
of the Unmade: Re-Shephir, the Midnight Mother.
Midnight Essence is a slick black substance, as are the
creatures made of it.
Midnight Essence possesses immense strength and
can even damage Shardplate with its attacks. If pierced,
Midnight Essence bleeds smoke; with enough damage,
its form deflates, resembling a punctured wineskin made
of black silk.
Midnight Essence can take different forms, from
humanoid to monstrous, often imitating what it sees
in its surroundings. Its form is fluid and can become
amorphous to squeeze through tight spaces.
```

```
Human Mimicry
Re-Shephir took up residence in the basement of
Urithiru after the old Knights Radiant abandoned the
tower. When the Alethi refugees from the Shattered
Plains arrived to occupy the tower-city, the Unmade
became fascinated with understanding humans.
She crafted Midnight Essence’s behavior to mimic
humans, focusing especially on the violence they
committed against each other. When confronted,
Re-Shephir defended herself with Midnight Essence,
shaping it loosely into imitations of the forms and faces
of nearby humans.
Re-Shephir was driven from Urithiru after a con-
frontation with Shallan Davar, a Lightweaver. Having
once been sealed away by a Knight Radiant of the same
order, Re-Shephir—and the Midnight Essence creatures
she creates—are terrified of Lightweaving.
```

```
Midnight Essence Tactics
A Midnight Essence is a close-range combatant who
uses Formed Weapon and Mimic Violence to mimic the
weapons and combat tactics of its enemies. If surrounded,
the Midnight Essence unnerves foes with Uncanny Nature
or uses Amorphous to escape where it can’t be followed.

VALERIA CASALE

Midnight Essence

can take many

forms.

```
Direform
A singer who bonds with a callousspren gains direform,
one of the Regal forms of power. Even before they
enhance their physical capability with Voidlight, their
strength and durability are a force to be reckoned with,
eclipsing even warform in raw battle prowess. Direform
also causes a singer to be more obedient to Odium and
their Fused commanders, even more so than other
Regals, while increasing their stubbornness toward
everyone else.
Direform Regals typically stand over seven feet tall,
covered in thick plates of stacked, interlocking carapace
resembling a full suit of plate armor. These plates are
covered in wicked, curved spikes, especially on the head
and shoulders. Direforms have no hairstrands, as their
carapace covers most of their head—along with the rest
of their body, leaving gaps only at their joints and face.
Due to the extraordinary danger a direform presents
in close combat, they’re often stationed as guards
within structures, typically for prisoners or important
provisions like gemstones. However, as the war for
Roshar has escalated, an increasing number of direforms
have been deployed to battlefields as heavy infantry.
```

```
Abilities
Direforms are incredibly strong and resilient with few
weaknesses, especially when their strength and speed
are increased with Voidlight. Their carapace is nearly
as tough as Shardplate, and their empowered strength
rivals a human Shardbearer. They expertly use their
carapace spikes to punish foes foolish enough to engage
with them in close quarters.
```

```
Direform Regal Tactics
A direform Regal is a brutal foe who seeks to dominate
in hand-to-hand combat. Until an enemy draws close
enough for the Regal to charge in with their Hammer, the
direform peppers enemies with their Longbow. Once a
foe nears, the direform closes the distance, uses Invested
Enhancement, and begins hammering away, mixing in the
Brace action to take advantage of their Spiked Carapace.
When a weakened foe attempts to flee, the direform uses
Tackle to cut off their escape.
```

```
Regal
A Regal is a singer who bonded a Voidspren and took a
form of power in a highstorm or the Everstorm. Most
other singers view Regals as chosen. Some Regals serve
the Fused, though they might not always agree with
what the Fused call them to do. For the most part,
Regals retain their identities, but their forms of power
make them susceptible to the influence of Odium, who
compels them to forsake their ancestral rhythms for
his own corrupted rhythms. (For more on singers and
rhythms, see “Rhythms of Roshar” in chapter 2.)
There are many types of Regals, but PCs are most
likely to encounter those in stormform. This profile also
presents a stat block for the heavily carapaced direform,
which dominates in close combat, along with a stat block
for the enigmatic nightform, which presents an indirect
challenge.

```

Nightform

A singer who bonds with a nightspren gains nightform,
one of the Regal forms of power. This grants them the
Voidbinding power of future sight, through which they
experience erratic visions of the future and can influence
events in their proximity.
Nightform Regals have unusually pliant leather-like
carapace, granting the singer nearly as much protection
as does warform. Their carapace is darker than normal,
closer to black than orange-red; in certain lights, the
skin underneath shimmers with small patterns. This
carapace covers most of the nightform’s body other than
their face, and a hood-like shell connects their forehead,
back, and sides of the head to their shoulders and base of
the neck. Though typically bald, some nightforms have
hairstrands that grow from the scalp beneath this hood.
When a nightform is available, a unit of singer
warriors is assigned one. This Regal uses their future
sight both as an early warning system for enemy contact
and as a receiver for relaying visions and directives
from Odium, becoming a battle strategist who identifies
enemy intentions before the enemy can even act.

```
Abilities
Though nightform doesn’t enhance a singer’s physique,
it grants exceptional night vision and improves the
speed at which they can absorb, process, and act on
information from various stimuli. In concert with
their future sight, nightform Regals can flicker their
perception between present and near-future moments
even amidst chaotic melees.
However, the power isn’t fully reliable, as there are far
too many variables and possibilities for future sight to be
perfectly accurate. Nightforms can influence events, but
their mastery of the course of fate is far from absolute.
Even so, the mere presence of a nightform prevents
enemies with their own future sight from benefiting
from the power, making any attempted glimpses of the
future a black void.

```

```
Nightform Regal Tactics
A nightform Regal is a wily and often-unpredictable enemy
who can react to events before they happen. They prefer
remaining far from their opponents, using their Predict
action and their Shortbow to harry their enemies while
aiding their allies in doing the same. Meanwhile, they use
Intervening Premonition to disrupt enemy maneuvers and
tell their allies where and how to attack. When an enemy
bears down on them, the nightform uses Glimpses of the
Future to deal devastating blows.

Stormform

A singer who bonds with a stormspren gains stormform,
one of the Regal forms of power. The listeners were
manipulated into reclaiming this form at the end of
the Era of Solitude. They used its power to summon
the Everstorm and return the Fused and Voidspren to
Roshar, beginning the True Desolation.
Stormform grants a subtle armor that shields the
singer nearly as much as warform’s bulky protection.
The armor is accented by barbed carapace, making them
difficult to grapple. The air around stormform singers
is frequently electrified by flashes of red lightning.
They are used as frontline soldiers to reinforce
standard troops, but also serve as elite units to carry
out more specialized tasks.

Abilities
Despite the form’s lithe appearance, stormform can
exceed the strength of warform, allowing a singer to
leap chasms with ease. Stormform’s greatest power is
the ability to summon lightning to electrocute foes,
though wielding it accurately requires significant focus.
Stormform is weak to water. They can withstand
small amounts with great effort, but if drenched, the
stormform can’t even summon lightning until they
fully dry off.

Stormform Regal Tactics
A stormform Regal is a cunning foe, one specialized in
closing distances and defending themself. The Regal

Chosen Riders
Unlike regular horses, Ryshadium can’t be broken
or trained. They also can’t be captured or taken out
of the wild unless they choose a rider. Their greater
intelligence grants them some understanding of people,
and Ryshadium only choose “worthy” riders—though
the qualifications for worthiness are unknown.
Generally, a Ryshadium only obeys their chosen
rider. They’re extremely loyal and will go so far as to
risk their lives to find and assist their rider. Rarely,
a Ryshadium may allow others to ride them, though
only after being sufficiently convinced of this necessity.
Sometimes they make exceptions without complaint,
such as when carrying wounded people to safety.
Though rare, it’s possible for a Ryshadium to choose
multiple worthy riders.
```

Ryshadium

```
Ryshadium are a unique species of sapient horse
characterized by their size, temperament, and
intelligence. Not only do they stand at least two hands
taller than other horses, but they’re faster, stronger, and
braver. Ryshadium have stone hooves that don’t need
to be shod, and they’re able to carry a Shardbearer in
full Plate.
These horses are one of the few species who
aren’t native to Roshar that have developed a
symbiotic bond with spren. A Ryshadium’s bond with
a musicspren grants the horse sapience and great
resilience. A Ryshadium’s bonded musicspren can
be pulled into the Physical Realm, sometimes even
manifesting as translucent ribbons that trail behind the
Ryshadium and accentuate their natural majesty.
Ryshadium live in wild herds that roam the western
part of the Rosharan continent, rarely straying eastward.
Within Shadesmar, Ryshadium uniquely leave behind
a glowing afterimage when they move.

Servant of Yelig-Nar
The Unmade Yelig-nar, known as the Blightwind, is one
of the ancient spren of Odium. Instead of manifesting
physically, Yelig-nar enters an amethyst gem, which a
singer or human can swallow to bond with him. Though
this bond grants his host incredible power, they’ll
inevitably be consumed by it.
When a person bonds Yelig-nar, dark smoke swirls
around them, and they gain the ability to manipulate
nine surges as well as preternatural prowess in battle.
The host retains their own personality and memories,
but as the host channels Yelig-nar’s power, their entire
body grows carapace armor and glowing amethyst
crystals. This process eventually hollows out the host’s
chest and replaces their organs—including their heart—
with an enormous gemstone that glows with Odium’s
light. If that gem is destroyed, the host is killed and
Yelig-nar escapes from their body.
```

```
Those Consumed
Yelig-nar was active during past Desolations. During
one, he broke into the chancery of Nohadon and killed
the king’s scribes. In combat, he could inhabit and
consume many hosts in turn, once doing so to a dozen
singers in a single battle.
During the True Desolation, Yelig-nar bonded two
different hosts. The first was Queen Aesudan Kholin of
Alethkar, though she was unable to control the Unmade
and he consumed her sometime after the siege of Kho-
linar. Yelig-nar’s second host was Highlord Meridas
Amaram, bonded during the Battle of Thaylen Field.
Though he fared better at controlling the Unmade and
managed to draw on Yelig-nar’s power during combat,
Amaram was ultimately killed.
```

```
Servant of Yelig-Nar Tactics
A servant of Yelig-nar can devastate groups of foes—or
divide and conquer them. They use Unmade Cohesion
to trap groups of foes, then Unmade Transformation
to incinerate them. Against individuals, they can use
infuriating hit-and-run tactics; for example, they might
close the distance with Skate or Unmade Gravitation,
strike with their Shardblade or Unmade Division, and then
use Unmade Gravitation to take to the skies. Their Crystal
Carapace provides further protection under heavy assault.
A servant of Yelig-nar can use nine surges—all except
Adhesion. The stat block presents condensed rules for four
surges, but GMs can use the rules from chapter 6 of the
Stormlight Handbook to wield all nine of their surge skills.
```

Shadesmar Spren
Lesser spren vary in how much they exist in the Physical
Realm versus the Cognitive. For those who abide
primarily in Shadesmar, only a small part of their body
is visible to inhabitants of the Physical Realm. For
example, the boiling pools of blood known as angerspren
in the Physical Realm are in truth only the drool from
the maw of the spren’s full form.
In stark contrast to the congregated societies of
Radiant spren, the lesser spren of Shadesmar tend to
be nomadic. Many inhabit the bead ocean, drawn to
people and phenomena in the equivalent locations
in the Physical Realm. Of those spren, many are
emotion spren, and several of their types are considered
incredibly dangerous in Shadesmar.
Even within Shadesmar, emotion spren are drawn
to emotions in the Physical Realm, and they gravitate
toward the places in Shadesmar that correspond to
those locations. They are also drawn to Stormlight
and significant uses of Surgebinding.
```

```
Shadesmar Appearances
Most spren aren’t dangerous, even in Shadesmar,
but some—like angerspren and painspren—can pose
significant threats to travelers in that realm. Angerspren
are drawn to anger, so travelers in Shadesmar are wise
to control their tempers. Otherwise, they’re likely
to encounter these lithe, six-legged predators with
whip-like tails and spines. Their toothy maws constantly
drool blood—and they hunt in packs, so you rarely
encounter just one.
In the Physical Realm, painspren harmlessly flock
to painful wounds, but in the Cognitive Realm, their
attraction to agony makes them far more dangerous.
These diminutive orange humanoids, faceless and
gaunt, are weak on their own—but as they swarm
a wounded character, their sinewy hands grasping
hungrily, the effect can be debilitating.
See “Spren” in chapter 1 for details on the spren
of Roshar, and see “Shadesmar Spren” in chapter 7 for
examples of how spren appear in the Cognitive Realm.
```

```
Shadesmar Spren Tactics
An angerspren can track individuals from afar
by sensing their prey’s anger. This spren is a
vicious attacker who quickly draws close to
Bite their prey. Should a target try to flee, the
angerspren’s retribution is swift; they use
Tail Wrap to trap their prey and Rend to heavily
injure them.

Shardbearer
Following the Day of Recreance, the dead Shards left
behind by the old Knights Radiant became coveted
objects and symbols of power. In the millennia to
come, in an era devoid of Radiants, the political and
martial power created by Shards only grew. When the
Hierocracy buried their origins, Shards gained new
mythologies, becoming gifts from the Almighty.
The term Shardbearer refers to anyone in posses sion
of either a Shardblade or Shardplate. “Full Shardbearer”
is used to indicate someone who possesses both a Blade
and Plate.
During the modern era of the True Desolation,
a Shardbearer can also refer to a member of the new
Knights Radiant wielding a living Blade or wearing
living Plate. However, this profile specifically covers
Shardbearers wielding dead Shards. (See chapter 7
of the Stormlight Handbook for more details on Shard-
blades and Shardplate.)
```

```
Shardblades
Shardblades are massive swords, typically six feet in
length or longer. Despite their size, they are lighter than
other blades. A person can bond to a dead Shardblade
using the gemstone embedded in its hilt. Once bound,
the Shardbearer can summon or dismiss their Blade at
will—though resummoning the Blade requires waiting
ten heartbeats.
A Shardblade cleanly cuts through non-living mate-
rial, but when used against a living target, a Shardblade
doesn’t leave physical wounds. Instead, the Blade cuts
the soul. Limbs damaged by a Shardblade turn grey,
becoming limp and numb, and if the Blade strikes the
spine or head, the victim’s eyes burn out and they die.
Stopping a Shardblade
The only things that can stop a Shardblade are another
Blade, Shardplate, a half-shard (a fabrial shield that can
withstand a Blade), or aluminum. A skilled enemy who
gets close enough can turn the Blade’s long reach into
an unwieldy liability.
When a Shardbearer dies, the bond with their Blade
is broken. If the Shardblade was dismissed, it appears
beside the corpse at the moment the bond breaks.
```

```
Shardplate
Dead Shardplate is fueled by Stormlight from gemstones
embedded on the inside of the armor. Plate greatly
enhances the strength and speed of its wearer, enabling
them to leap long distances, run at high speeds, carry
items of significant weight, and withstand blows that
would crush a person in regular armor.

```

```
Fields of Battle
In the Vorin nations, especially Alethkar, Shards are
used on two important battlegrounds: the dueling arena
and the field of war. Swordmaster ardents teach young
boys to wield Shardblades using the ten Shardblade
stances—fighting styles used for both duels and war.
Each stance is named after one of the Ten Essences
(see the “Soulcaster Savant” profile later in this chapter).
```

```
Dueling
The Vorin kingdoms consider a duel between
Shardbearers to be a form of art. These fights are
grand spectacles, with many rules enforced by tradition
rather than law. Duelists are expected to use traditional
dueling styles and to fight with slow grace, rather than
finishing the fight as quickly as possible.
Duels are moderated by a highjudge. Some duels are
fought merely with Blades, but in a duel between full
Shardbearers, the winner is typically determined by the
number of shattered pieces of Plate. Duels are normally
declared for one of three reasons: for enjoyment, for
competition, or for recompense.
```

```
Wa r
During war, Shardbearers typically only join the most
important battles, as their strategic assignment can turn
the tide of nearly any battle.
One common tactic is for the Shardbearer to lead
at the front of a formation, cutting through the enemy
line, sowing indiscriminate chaos, and leaving openings
for regular soldiers to exploit. In a defensive fight, a
Shardbearer might reinforce areas where the soldiers
are flagging, giving them a chance to recuperate before
moving elsewhere along the defensive line.
On the battlefield, Shardbearers must be cautious
not to hurt their own allies with wild, uncontrolled
swings. A Shardbearer’s honor guard often supports
them from a cautious distance—far enough to avoid
the carnage, but close enough to help the Shardbearer
retreat in an emergency.

```
Shardbearer Tactics
Shardbearers are incredible warriors who control the
battlefield. A duelist Shardbearer disrupts their opponents
with Feint and uses their exceptional mobility to position
themselves for Flamestance or Windstance. With Jarring
Insight, a duelist is a threat to their opponent’s plans both
in and out of combat.
An elite Shardbearer carefully gauges their opponent
and adapts accordingly. They may use Ironstance or Flame-
stance alongside Distracting Banter to quickly brutalize
an enemy, or they might use Bloodstance to play with risk.
Their Test Blow helps them to target an opponent’s weak
spots with future attacks.

Shellmite
Shellmites are crustaceans who live in large nests,
working together to support a single colony. They
resemble plate-sized crabs with rocky shells, but
when they retract their limbs, they’re almost perfectly
camouflaged as rocks. Different shellmites play
specialized roles to support their nest, from lighter-
shelled workers to sharp-shelled soldiers. An individual
shellmite presents little threat, and their exoskeletons
contain succulent meat. But a group of shellmites can
be a death trap, and hunters mark suspected nests with
bright red paint as a warning to steer clear.

them. Each shellmite within 5 feet of the target can

keen damage per frenzied shellmite.
```

```
Shellmite Tactics
A shellmite uses their Rugged Camouflage to hide among
common rocks. When unlucky travelers walk into a nest of
shellmites, these crustaceans strike quickly with a Pincer,
gaining an advantage on their first attack. Shellmites then
use their Feeding Frenzy to overwhelm intruders, tearing
and ripping at clothing and armor with their strong claws,
while sticking together to take advantage of their numbers.
Shellmites are reliant on surprise, so try placing multiple
hidden shellmites throughout an area to keep PCs on
their toes.

Singer
While singers bear some resemblance to humans, their
species has been on Roshar much longer and they’re
physically distinct. Singer skin is colored with swirls of
red, black, and white, known as marblings, which can
vary widely in pattern and are typically either red-black
or red-white, though rare singers possess skin of all
three colors. Singer hair is generally orange or red, and
their bodies are typically covered at least in part by
carapace, often covering their head and arms. Their
eyes are gray-black, and their powerful teeth can chew
through shells.
Singers take their name from their ability to
communicate using special rhythms tied to Roshar itself.
They also can change their form by forming a bond
with spren; each form changes the singer both physically
and mentally. For many singers, this ability is relatively
new; for millennia, singers were called parshmen and
enslaved by humans after many singers had portions
of their Identity and Connection ripped away. They
have since been healed by the Everstorm and restored
to full self-determination. (See “Singers and Listeners”
in chapter 2 for more details on the singers.)
```

```
Singer Forms
Singers have gemhearts fused to their sternums; these
allow them to bond with spren, changing their form,
appearance, abilities, and mentality. Each form has
a specific purpose, making the singer more suited for
a task such as combat or artistic expression.
People who face singers in combat are most likely to
encounter them in warform or workform. In warform,
singers become taller, bulkier, and have a full armor-like
carapace; they also have increased strength, stamina,
and durability. Meanwhile, nimbleform singers are
less intimidating and durable in combat, but their lithe
bodies make them excellent scouts.
When Odium’s forces first clashed with Dalinar’s
coalition, many singers were inexperienced in battle or
uncertain about their role in the conflict. As the True
Desolation continues, under the supervision of the
immortal Fused, singer armies have become a deadly
match for human forces.

singer relies on their External Carapace for relief from
an onslaught while their warpair continues fighting.

at tracking creatures and surveying an area, and they can
easily exploit an enemy’s weakness using their Chosen

```
A Culture in Conflict
Singers are one of the major cultural forces on Roshar.
As parshmen subjugated by humans, they became a
large part of the economic engine of many nations and
kingdoms. In addition, the listeners—a community of
singers based in the city of Narak—have been in conflict
with the Alethi for years in the War of the Reckoning.
Complicating both of these relationships are the Fused,
ancient singer souls who can possess the bodies of living
singers. The Fused, who hold deep hatred for humans,
command the newly formed singers to conquer Roshar
in Odium’s name.

Skybreaker
Widely seen as fanatics, members of the Skybreaker
order of the Knights Radiant believe in a strict moral
code and uphold the law above nearly all other things.
They were the only order not to abandon their oaths
during the Recreance, instead operating in secret for
millennia under the guidance of Nale, the Herald of
Justice. In the aftermath of the Everstorm, Nale and
most other Skybreakers have chosen to follow the
singers, believing that the singers have the right to
Roshar as the original owners of the land.
```

```
Surgebinding
Skybreakers use the surges of Gravitation and Division,
which they receive from bonding with highspren.
Through the surge of Gravitation, Skybreakers can
change the direction and strength of an object’s
gravitational attraction; they can use this to fly and run
up walls, or even to send other people and objects flying.
Using the surge of Division, Skybreakers can touch
an object and cause it (or part of it) to burn, turn to
dust, or decay, such as by burning a pattern on a piece
of wood. Most Skybreakers don’t gain this ability
until they declare the Third Ideal of their order; this
progression is slowed compared to other orders, so
few Skybreakers gain this surge.
```

```
Skybreaker Tactics
A Skybreaker of the Second Ideal is an aerial combatant
who wields Gravitation to devastating effect. They begin
combat with Gravitational Support to gain a tactical
advantage, then use Offensive Gravitation and Lashing
Shot against foes both near and far. They freely Menace
combatants—and if they’re a powerful Skybreaker of the
Fourth Ideal , they also add the Division surge to their
repertoire, using Inescapable Decay to weaken their
heavily armored foes.
Skybreakers dedicate themselves to pursuing justice.
As such, they’re likely to prioritize foes whom they deem
criminals, initially ignoring others whom they don’t feel the
need to apprehend and punish.

succeed on a DC 16 Agility test or their armor rusts and
decays, permanently decreasing its deflect value by 1.
Armor damaged in this way can be repaired with proper
materials as a downtime activity.
Gravitational Support (Costs 1 Investiture). The
Skybreaker gains a flying rate of 40 feet until the start
of their next turn. At the start of each of their turns, they
can spend 1 Investiture to maintain this effect for an
additional round.
Alternatively, they can infuse an ally with a flying rate
of 40 feet until the end of the ally’s next turn. When the
Skybreaker does so, they can spend additional Investiture
to extend this effect for a number of rounds equal to the
Investiture spent.
Offensive Gravitation (Costs 1 Investiture). The
Skybreaker makes a Gravitation test against the Physical
defense of a target within reach. On a success, they move
the target up to 40 feet in any direction, and the target
becomes Restrained until the start of the Skybreaker’s
next turn. If the target hits an object or surface, they take
13 (2d12) impact damage. If the target passes within reach
of an object that they aren’t going to hit, they can make a
DC 16 Agility test, grabbing the object and stopping this
forced movement on a success.
Regenerate (Costs 1 Investiture). The Skybreaker
recovers 7 (1d6 + 4) health. They can use this free action
even while Unconscious or otherwise prevented from
using actions.
Menace. After the Skybreaker is hit with an attack, they
make an Intimidation test against the attacker’s Cognitive
defense. On a success, the attacker loses 1d4 focus.
opportunities and complications
The following options are available when an enemy gains
an Opportunity or Complication during a scene with the
Skybreaker:
Opportunity. An enemy can spend to prevent the
Skybreaker from using their Offensive Gravitation, Distant
Decay, and Regenerate actions until the end of the
Skybreaker’s next turn.
Complication. The GM can spend from an enemy’s test to
have the Skybreaker use their Distant Decay action as.

On Roshar, the Sleepless have bred their hordelings
to resemble cremlings. They can separate an individual
hordeling from their main body, allowing it to move
independently from the main host while maintaining a
connection that allows it to act as a spy.
As a Sleepless can create new hordelings to replace
lost ones, each Sleepless is functionally immortal so long
as they don’t lose all their essential hordelings.
```

```
Dawnshard Protectors
During the Heraldic Epochs, the Sleepless made their
home in the Silver Kingdom of Aimia. A few survived
the scouring of Aimia, but rather than flee the isles as
other survivors did, most Sleepless continued guarding
the Dawnshard mural hidden beneath the ruins
of Akinah.
The Sleepless are aware of the wider cosmere and
know that evil forces search for the Dawnshard. To
protect the Dawnshard, the Sleepless were merciless,
sabotaging vessels bound for Aimia and slaughtering
their crews.
During the True Desolation, their vigil as they
knew it came to an end. An expedition led by Rysn Ftori
succeeded in reaching Aimia, and the Dawnshard joined
with her. While many of the Sleepless monitor her to
ensure the Dawnshard’s safety, others are now more
willing to work with humans and Radiants.
```

```
Sleepless (Aimian)
Dysian Aimians are from a sapient, non-human race
that isn’t native to Roshar. Each “individual” Aimian
is actually a collective mind comprised of many
small creatures called hordelings. Dysian Aimians
call themselves the Sleepless because some of their
hordelings are always awake.
A Sleepless’s hordelings can arrange themselves in
any shape, allowing them to mimic the form of other
creatures (such as humans). The Sleepless selectively
breed their hordelings to evolve specific traits to better
blend in with their local ecosystem, though this work
takes generations. Some Sleepless have even cultivated
protrusions and body shapes that convincingly mimic
human features and appendages.
```

```
Sleepless Tactics
In combat, a Sleepless aims to rapidly destabilize and
overwhelm foes. First they Ravage to begin ongoing
damage, then Overwhelm in an attempt to smother their
foe. Each time they take impact or keen damage, they use
Divisible to send out a hordeling. If the combat goes awry,
their Swarm Weapon can give them an edge. When they
have an action to spare, they often Unsettle their foes.
Outside combat, the Sleepless uses their Divide
when they need to create one or more hordelings for
reconnaissance.

if the Sleepless has at least 25 health, they can smother the
target. While smothering a target, the Sleepless occupies the
target’s space and can’t attack other enemies. At the start
of each of the Sleepless’s turns, a smothered target takes
7 (2d6) vital damage. If the Sleepless takes more than 20
damage from a single attack or is reduced below 25 health,
they release the smothered target, fall Prone within 5 feet

Unsettle (Costs 1 Focus). The Sleepless eerily distorts
their form toward an enemy they can sense within 30 feet
of them. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Discipline test
or lose 1d4 focus.
Divide. The Sleepless can divide the swarm that comprises
them, decreasing their health by 5 per hordeling sent
out. Each hordeling is a Small character with 5 health who
otherwise uses the statistics of a Sleepless. These hordelings
immediately gain a reaction, but they can’t use actions until
the next round. Anything a hordeling learns is known by the
rest of their horde.
Swarm Weapon. After the Sleepless is hit by a melee
attack, the hordelings that comprise them can momentarily
swarm the attacker’s weapon, giving the attacker a
disadvantage on their next test against the Sleepless.

Soldier
Life on Roshar often involves war, and there is no war
without soldiers. As battles play out across the world
stage, some leaders may be tempted to treat soldiers
as expendable, willing to throw sheer numbers at the
enemy without concern for the cost. However, Roshar’s
military powers would be nothing without their soldiers
on the ground.
```

```
Roles of Soldiers
The role and skill of soldiers varies from military to
military, but generally they fall into three groups:
rank-and-file soldiers, soldiers with specialized training,
and officers and military leaders. Depending on their
training, experience, and expertise, each type of soldier
may pose a different threat and opportunity to those
they encounter.
```

```
Rank-and-File Soldiers
Most foot soldiers are trained in one or two weapons
and used as ground troops on the front lines, typically
to fight for a specific position or resource. The indiv-
idual weapons used by these soldiers vary widely from
one region to another. In the Azish Empire, soldiers
wield bows, spears, and greatshields, and they don
colorful caps along with plated mail. Meanwhile, in
Alethkar—which has the largest standing military force
on Roshar—most ground troops wield spears or bows,
and the use of swords is restricted to officers. And in
Jah Keved, troops are known not for their weapons,
but for their strategy of harrying the enemy without
engaging in direct conflict.

lower classes to advance; in so doing, they automatically
increase their rank in the caste—or nahn—by one. For
people of low enough nahn, they might even be forcibly
conscripted if their role in their local community
isn’t seen as valuable. Even for lighteyes, advancing
as an officer also increases ranking in their caste,
known as dahn.
In Shinovar, soldiers live next to monasteries and
follow the command of the General, who answers to
the Farmer. A select few warriors serve as acolytes to
Honorbearers inside the monasteries, learning advanced
combat techniques and training with the Blades
themselves. In extreme cases, Oathstones are given
to soldiers as a method of punishment only surpassed
in severity by death.
```

```
The Thrill
The Thrill is a phenomenon documented in a few
regions throughout Roshar. Caused by the Unmade
Nergaoul, the Thrill instills what’s described as a
combination of a desire to compete and win, an ability
to ignore pain and other concerns that distract from
victory, and increased focus. Though most often
associated with battle, the Thrill can be experienced
at any time.
Alethi soldiers, specifically, desire to feel the
Thrill, though they think of it as an intensely private
experience and don’t speak of it if they’ve felt it. While
experiencing the Thrill is exhilarating, it can lead a
soldier under its influence to commit especially heinous
acts, as it gives that person the ability to ignore their
empathy and inclination toward mercy during the heat
of battle.
```

Specialized Soldiers
Some Rosharan militaries use specialized groups of
soldiers. Many of these soldiers receive dedicated
training, while others simply need to be separated
from the troops around them for logistical reasons.
For example, the Alethi and Azish militaries both
use cavalry where horses are available, creating a
specialized role both for the officers who ride in the
cavalry and the horse grooms who care for the animals.
Meanwhile, the bridge crews of Alethkar aren’t
prized specialists—but they carry heavy bridges
that allow other soldiers to cross the chasms of the
Shattered Plains. These bridge crews are an attractive
target to enemy soldiers, and because of this high
casualty rate, officers fill the crews with enslaved
people, deserters, criminals, and those without
anywhere else to go.

Officers and Leaders
During battle, most Rosharan military forces have
officers who command a group of ground and
specialized troops. Some officer positions hold little
authority, and merely reflect the soldier’s rank and
ability, but many officers oversee either large or small
groupings of their fellow soldiers.
The Azish Empire’s army is divided into battalions
of approximately one thousand soldiers each. Groups of
cavalry are directed by officers known as cavalrylords,
whose bright red trousers stand out on the battlefield.
Among the Alethi, who have a more militaristic
culture and strict rules about caste and social mobility,
officer roles are prescribed, ranging from sergeants
(who oversee a subsquad of six to eight soldiers) to
battalionlords and generals (who command groups of
one thousand and two thousand soldiers, respectively).
Alethi officers, who must be lighteyed, are the only
members of the army regularly permitted to use swords.
While soldiers usually serve similar functions from
one military force to another, the role of officers can
shift depending on the needs and focus of an individual
military power. In Thaylenah, for example, many
officers specialize in naval combat because of the
nation’s reliance on ships.

Becoming a Soldier

There are many routes to becoming a soldier; some
pursue it as a passion or calling, some are forced
to join, and others view it as a way out of difficult
circumstances. In the Vorin kingdoms, joining the
military is one of the easiest ways for people of the

```
Soldier Tactics
Soldiers are trained to be effective on a battlefield in their
specialized roles. An archer fights at a distance. They use
Immobilizing Shot to immediately take the upper hand,
then follow up with Longbow.
A spear infantry topples enemies with their Shield
Bash and then strikes with their Shortspear. Their Military
Tactics can be used to pin down fleeing targets or bolster
their fellow soldiers, depending on how the battle is going.
A Thrill berserker rushes into battle, undeterred by
formidable enemies and careful fortifications. They fight
with alarming ferocity, using Berserker Rage and Shield
Bash to cleave their path, regardless of whether friend or
foe stands in the way.

Effects on the Soulcaster
While Soulcasting isn’t inherently dangerous, doing
so long-term can have irreversible effects on the user.
Over time, a Soulcaster can become a savant—a person
whose body slowly transforms into the Essence they
most frequently use. As a Soulcaster continues to work
with that Essence, they lose more and more of their
body to it.
```

```
Soulcaster Savant
The people known as Soulcasters use the surge of
Transform ation to convert one material into another.
The work of Soulcasters can be one of the literal
building blocks of a community. In addition to
creating food out of inedible materials, Soulcasting can
transform cheaper building materials into more durable
or luxurious ones, dispose of waste in lieu of plumbing,
and obtain metals that are difficult to mine or extract.
Because of how valued these skills are, the gems needed
for Soulcasting can be in great demand. Emeralds are
particularly prized, as they fuel the work of Soulcasters
who create food.
```

```
Soulcasting With Fabrials
Most Soulcasters are aided in their work by ancient
fabrials worn on their hands, which bear the same
name of Soulcasters. These fabrials require specific
gemstones imbued with Stormlight; the type depends on
which Essence a Soulcaster wishes to produce (see the
upcoming “Soulcasting Essences” section).
In Vorin society, Soulcasters can only be used
by ardents, and their use is shrouded in secrecy.
The person Soulcasting must send their mind into
Shadesmar, connect with the Cognitive aspect of the
object they want changed, then convince it to make that
change. The effort requires large amounts of Stormlight,
which can crack any gemstone used in the process.
A Soulcaster can target either an inanimate object
or a person, though Soulcasting is more difficult on
targets with high levels of Investiture. Soulcasting
usually requires physically touching the object being
transformed, but some Soulcasters can use their abilities
at a distance.
Soulcasters can transform many objects, but most
only work with one or two specific Essences; such
Soulcasters can’t transform items into any other
Essences. Even with this restriction, Soulcasting is a
powerful tool, used for everything from ridding the
blood of poison to creating food from inedible materials.
In addition to saving lives, however, Soulcasters can use
their abilities in combat by Soulcasting a person into
another material, killing the target in the process.

Soulcasting Essences
In the Vorin religion, the Ten Essences are linked to
individual Heralds and are believed to encompass
different aspects of human, elemental, and divine
attributes. These Essences include forms of matter that
can be manipulated via Soulcasting.
Soulcasting focuses on transforming items into an
Essence, each of which is associated with a specific
gem and type of material, as listed on the Soulcasting
Essences table.

transform the object into one of their Essences. They can
spend 2 focus to target a Large object instead.
Fire. The Soulcaster transforms air into fire around their
foes. Each enemy within 5 feet of them takes 9 (2d8) energy
damage. The Soulcaster can spend 1 focus per enemy in
range to cause that fire to set the enemies’ clothes aflame.
A character in burning clothes becomes Afflicted [2d8

 to put out the fire.
Soulcast Protection (Costs 2 Focus). Before a ranged
attack hits the Soulcaster or an ally within 5 feet of them, the
Soulcaster makes a Discipline test. If their result is greater
than the triggering attack test, the Soulcaster transforms the

attack to miss.
```

```
Soulcaster Savant Tactics
A Soulcaster savant transforms material around them into
one of the Ten Essences. By custom, ardents trained as
Soulcasters don’t use these abilities against living people;
if attacked, such a devout ardent would likely flee while
using Soulcast Protection, or perhaps transform objects
in their environment to help them escape (such as by
creating cover with Smoke or Fire).
However, a Soulcaster savant who is driven to
extremes—or one bearing a stolen fabrial—could be a
formidable foe. They can attempt to transform a target’s
body into an Essence with Smoke, Fire, or Stone. Against a
myriad of foes, such a Soulcaster begins with Fire against
a group, hoping to damage as many foes as possible.
They use Stone against a single foe to slow them down,
especially if they can use Soulcast Protection to evade
ranged attacks. After the enemy is either aflame or
Slowed, the Soulcaster uses Smoke for heavy damage.
Most Soulcaster fabrials only allow their user to wield
one or two Essences; however, the precious fabrial used
in this profile’s stat block grants the Soulcaster savant
control over three Essences.

Squire
Some Knights Radiant are accompanied by squires,
to whom the Radiant grants a limited ability to use
Stormlight and the Radiant’s surges. Squires hold
Stormlight less efficiently than Knights Radiant do,
though some believe their abilities in this area grow
as they spend more time with the Knights Radiant
they follow.
The role of squires varies widely from order to
order, and several orders are said to not take squires
at all. For those who do, the squire usually has sworn
the First Ideal of the Knights Radiant and is thought
to be a potential Radiant themself. However, this isn’t
a requirement; at minimum, squires are usually asked
to share the belief system of their Radiant’s order.
While some squires do become full Knights Radiant,
this isn’t required or expected, and some remain squires
all their lives. Many believe that spren gauge a squire’s
readiness for a bond during the squire’s time with a
Knight Radiant, reducing the chances of a spren being
harmed by a failed oath.
A squire isn’t committed to bonding the spren
associated with their order, nor to being a squire of only
one order. Their powers, though, are tied to the power
of the Knight Radiant they are a squire for and that
Radiant’s spren. Squires must be within approximately
50 miles of their Radiant to use their powers, but their
powers already weaken significantly after 30 miles.
If a squire and their Radiant are suddenly separated,
the squire can continue to use their power for only
an hour or two.
```

```
Squires and Orders
Becoming a squire offers an entry point into specific
orders for those who wish to join the work of the
Knights Radiant but can’t immediately become
Radiants themselves. Squires gain valuable training
in Surgebinding and offer support to the Knights
Radiant and their order.
The requirements to become a squire vary from
order to order. The Windrunners have created a system
of ranks within the overall title of squire that fits
with their militaristic culture, giving squires a sense
of progression before they become Knights Radiant
(if they become Knights Radiant at all). Perhaps as a
result, they have more squires than most other orders.
Skybreakers, by contrast, can only take squires
if they complete the Fourth Ideal and become masters.
Other orders known to take squires include the Dust-
bringers, Lightweavers, Willshapers, Stonewards, and
Bondsmiths.

to the ground, while their Gravitation allows a quick escape
if necessary.

Creating Other Squire Adversaries
This chapter presents an example stat block for the
Windrunner squire, but this stat block can be adjusted to
reflect a squire from any Radiant order. This is useful if a
Radiant PC gains a squire companion, or if an ally or enemy
has a squire who appears in scenes with them.
The GM can use this stat block to create a squire from
another order with the following steps:
Replace Surge Skills. Remove the stat block’s surge
skills of Adhesion and Gravitation, and replace them
with the two surge skills gained by PCs of the desired
Radiant order (see the Radiant Orders table in chapter
5 of the Stormlight Handbook ).
Replace Surge Actions. Remove the stat block’s Adhesion
action and Gravitation action, and replace them with
the desired Radiant order’s two surge actions (see
chapter 6 of the Stormlight Handbook ).
Adjust Stats if Desired. If you wish, you can optimize the
squire’s statistics by moving a few points from one
attribute to another, increasing their skill modifier in
their surge skills. If you change any attributes, also
adjust health, focus, and Investiture accordingly
(see chapter 3 of the Stormlight Handbook ).

Thunderclast

```
Thunderclasts are stone creatures who appear during
Desolations to serve Odium. They’re shaped roughly
like an enormous humanoid, but five to six times that
size, with long limbs and spiky, clawed fingers. Their
stone body is primarily skeletal in appearance, with a
chest composed of visible rib-like protrusions, ridges
along their back, a narrow head that looks like a large
arrowhead, and red glowing eyes. With their hands
alone measuring five feet in length, they are extremely
dangerous to humans and a challenge for even the
strongest of Knights Radiant.
Like the Fused, thunderclasts are animated by
Cognitive Shadows who assume physical form by
sinking into a stone of their choice. Only three beings
are capable of forming thunderclasts, and they return
with each Desolation. They take on the color and
characteristics of the stone they inhabit, but each
individual thunderclast can be distinguished by
the shape of its form. If a thunderclast’s rock-body
becomes incapacitated, they can inhabit a new form in
just a few days, enabling them to join battle after battle.
```

```
Despite their size and strength, thunderclasts
are also agile. They wield their bodies as a terrible
weapon, slamming into fortifications and buildings
with ease. However, they aren’t confined to brute force:
Thunderclasts can also throw boulders with precision,
carry allied Fused without causing harm to their fragile
bodies, and perform similar subtle and targeted acts.
Though thunderclasts are made of stone, they
aren’t injured by their attacks on stone buildings and
fortifications, and they can’t be destroyed through
ordinary means. Shardblades can carve a thunderclast
into pieces, leaving them unable to move and attack—
but this endeavor can be incredibly dangerous to both
Shardbearers and nearby buildings (and people).
Nightblood, a sentient sword and Shardblade, is one
of the only known items that can permanently kill
a thunderclast, as the sword is highly destructive
against manifestations in the Physical, Cognitive,
and Spiritual Realms.
Thunderclasts have some sense of self, responding
to individual names and obeying commands, but they
don’t deign to communicate with humans beyond
earth-shaking roars and trumpeting sounds that
express emotions.

22 (4d10) impact damage. On a success, they take 11 (2d10)
impact damage.
Crushing Palm. The thunderclast uses their palm
to grind an enemy against the ground. The target must

26 (4d12) impact damage and is Stunned until the end of
their next turn. On a success, the target takes 13 (2d12)
impact damage and is Disoriented until the end of their
next turn.
opportunities and complications
The following options are available when an enemy gains
an Opportunity or Complication during a scene with the
thunderclast:
Opportunity. An enemy can spend to prevent the thunder-
clast from using their Crushing Palm action or spending
focus until the end of the thunderclast’s next turn.
Complication. The GM can spend from an enemy’s test
to have the thunderclast use their Crushing Palm action as
```

. The target gains a disadvantage on the Athletics test
against this action.

```
History
Thousands of years ago, three thunderclasts—
Kai-garnis, Terushal, and Yushah—were created from
the souls of ancient singers. These thunderclasts were
seen in previous ages, but they eventually passed into
the realm of myth and legend. Some stories spoke
of Voidbringers with bodies of stone, but while this
may have been a reference to cultural memory of the
thunderclasts, they weren’t referred to more definitively
than this for generations.
A thunderclast first reappeared in the modern age at
the siege of Kholinar, destroying the city’s wall and kill-
ing many of its defenders. During the Battle of Thaylen
Field, Odium called upon Kai-garnis and Yushah
to again take physical form; Yushah was ultimately
sundered by Nightblood, permanently kiling her.
```

```
Thunderclast Tactics
A thunderclast is a brutal foe capable of leveling cities.
They use Smash and Throw Boulder against groups of
harrying enemies, but they can also focus damage on one
target with Kick, and even temporarily remove a threat
with Crushing Palm. Thunderclasts sometimes act to
protect Fused or harass the Fused’s targets.

```

```
Whitespine
Whitespines are deadly horse-sized predators, named for
the row of spikes that runs down the carapace on their
backs. They move on two legs and have two sets of arms
with long, wicked claws. Whitespines possess a pair of
tusks that they use to impale prey. After puncturing a
creature, these tusks can snap, remaining stuck inside
the wound; the subsequent blood loss and infection can
cause serious damage or death.
Whitespines have large nostrils and rely on their
sense of smell; while their small recessed eyes allow
for good peripheral vision, their long-distance sight
is very limited. To more easily find meals, whitespines
make their dens near frequently traveled roads and
prey on travelers. After stripping the meat from a kill,
a whitespine hides nearby, then ambushes the scavengers
that come to feast on the remains. A whitespine den is
strewn with the bones of their meals.
Whitespines hibernate by entering a dormant state
and covering themselves in a crystalline substance,
though highstorms and other water can wash it off
before it accumulates and hardens. They fare poorly
in captivity.
```

```
Cultural Influence
Lighteyed nobles often take their darkeyed retainers to
hunt whitespines together. While sometimes done for
sport, these hunts are also organized when a white spine
becomes a danger to humans. Whitespine tusks are
prized trophies, and over time, their color transitions
from a bone grey to a polished white. The tusks can be
displayed as is, or an artisan can engrave the surface
or carve it into different forms.
Infamously dangerous, whitespines are often
referenced in idioms. “Whitespine’s den” is used as
a metaphor for dangerous situations. People can be
compared to whitespines to either underscore their
unpleasantness or the danger they pose. Wet white-
spines also have a notoriously awful smell that can
be referenced as an insult.
Whitespine Tactics
As a dangerous predator, a whitespine stalks their prey
with intent to ambush and surprise them. The whitespine
charges at weak opponents in the distance, dealing extra
damage with their Tusks, then they follow with their Claws
to leave prey bleeding out. Whitespines don’t fear leaving
an enemy’s reach to charge another, as only precise blows
can avoid the whitespine’s Spined Carapace. When a
fight goes poorly, whitespines use Pheromone Release
to stupefy their opponents so the whitespine can either
retreat or overwhelm them.

```
Eyes of Red and Blue
Marabethia has a similar practice to hog wrestling.
Prisoners sentenced to capital punishment are given a
unique alternative: They’re dangled over a cliff at high
tide with gashes in their cheeks as bait for the yu-nerig.
If they survive a week without being eaten, they can
go free. Prisoners are nearly always attacked within a
day, yet many take the chance. This practice produced
a Marabethian figure of speech about someone with
false hope; this saying, “You have eyes of red and blue,”
refers to the prisoners seeing crimson blood dripping
down and the endless expanse of blue sea.
```

```
Yu-nerig
Yu-nerig are a species of aquatic greatshell with massive
claws. They reside underwater, emerging to pupate or
seek prey along the Marabethian coast. Their bonds
with spren cause them to grow to large sizes, though
they aren’t as feared as chasmfiends—and in fact,
yu-nerig are considered delicacies.
```

```
Hog Wrestling
Brightlord Sheler, a commander in Meridas Amaram’s
army, was taken captive by the Herdazians for murder
and robbery. He was given three options: beheading,
torture, or wrestling “the hog.” He chose the latter,
assuming it was a pig, only to find himself doused in oil
and left on the beach. The “hog” emerged—a massive
yu-nerig with horrible claws. Sheler didn’t survive
the encounter.
```

```
Yu-Nerig Tactics
A yu-nerig is a brutal combatant who grips an enemy in
their deadly Claw. Depending on the battle, they might
Hurl this enemy at another target, or they might use
their Vital Slam for massive damage. When surrounded,
the yu-nerig attacks with their Hammer Claw, while their
Thick Carapace provides powerful defense.

a success.
The yu-nerig has two claws, each of which can restrain one
enemy. While restraining an enemy in a claw, that claw can
only attack the Restrained enemy.
```

```
Hammer Claw. Attack +8, reach 5 ft., up to five targets.
The yu-nerig can’t use this action if both claws are restraining
enemies. Graze: 9 (2d8) impact damage. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8)
impact damage.
Hurl. The yu-nerig throws an enemy who is Restrained in
their claw to a space the yu-nerig can sense within 30 feet
of them. The thrown enemy must make a DC 16 Agility test.
On a failure, the thrown enemy takes 1d8 impact damage
for every 10 feet they were thrown. On a success, the thrown
enemy takes half that much damage.
If the enemy is thrown at a space occupied by another
character, the thrown enemy lands in the nearest unoccupied
space, and the other character must succeed on a DC 16
Agility test or take the same damage as the thrown enemy.
Vital Slam (Costs 1 Focus). The yu-nerig flips an enemy
who is Restrained in their claw and slams them against the
ground. The target must make a DC 16 Athletics test. On
a success, the target takes 6 (1d10) impact damage. On a
failure, the target takes 16 (3d10) impact damage and is
knocked Prone.

Opportunity. An enemy can spend to prevent the yu-nerig
from using their Hurl and Vital Toss actions until the end of
the yu-nerig’s next turn.
Complication. The GM can spend from an enemy’s test to
have the yu-nerig use their Hammer Claw action as.
