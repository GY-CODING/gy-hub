```
he Cosmere Roleplaying Game is a
tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) in which
you and a group of friends collaboratively tell
a story of heroes in a universe of adventure and
powerful Investiture. This handbook provides rules
for playing in the world of Roshar—the setting for
the Stormlight Archive novels. In this game, you and
your fellow players take on the roles of characters from
around the world, working together to determine how
your stories unfold as you face a cataclysmic era of
global conflict.
```

```
The Cosmere RPG
The planet Roshar is a small part of a much larger
universe known as the cosmere. Dozens of inhabited
worlds fill the cosmere—worlds of mist, of color, and
of powerful divine magic, worlds where adventures
abound. The Cosmere RPG uses a rules system
designed for not only adventures on Roshar, but
on any of these worlds.
```

```
Adventures on Roshar
The first books of the Cosmere RPG focus on the
acclaimed Stormlight setting. The battle for the cosmere
begins here, as the Knights Radiant and Odium’s forces
wield powerful Investiture in a conflict spanning all
of Roshar.
```

**Introduction**

```
The core Stormlight books for the Cosmere RPG
include the following:
Stormlight Handbook. You’re reading this book now!
It contains the foundational rules for playing the game,
such as how to create characters, roll dice, and play
out scenes. You’ll use this handbook alongside either
a published adventure or the Stormlight World Guide ,
which provides lore and adversary profiles you can
use to create your own adventures.
Stormlight World Guide. This guide explores the
history and cultures of Roshar and its place in the
cosmere. This book contains new canonical lore in
the form of character biographies, timelines, and
travelogues. It also provides adversary profiles for
a wide range of non-player characters (NPCs).
Stonewalkers. The first official Stormlight adventure,
written in close partnership with Brandon Sanderson
and Dan Wells, takes players from 1st through 8th level
on an adventure across the continent of Roshar.
```

```
Adventures Beyond Roshar
Whether you’re ready to adventure throughout the
cosmere, or whether you simply want to introduce a
character from another world, the Stormlight Handbook
is just the beginning! You can expand your adventures
with other books in the Cosmere RPG series, including
the upcoming Mistborn Handbook , Mistborn World
Guide , and Mistborn Legacy adventure.
```

```
Introduction 1
```

```
The Knights Radiant must stand again.
The ancient oaths have at last been spoken; the spren return.
Men seek what was lost; I fear the quest will destroy them.
It is the nature of magic. A broken soul
has cracks into which something else can be fit.
Surgebindings, the powers of creation themselves;
they can brace a broken soul, but they can also widen its fissures.
```

```
MICAH EPSTEIN
```

```
Chapter 10: Combat. This describes how to engage in
a combat scene, including the general actions every
character can use and the rules for targeting, making
attacks, and moving around the battlefield.
Chapter 11: Conversations. This provides the rules for
tense conversation scenes in which characters attempt
to influence each other’s opinions or behavior.
Chapter 12: Endeavors. This presents rules for high-
stakes endeavor scenes such as solving mysteries and
conspiracies, exploring dangerous environments,
and pursuing (or fleeing) adversaries in adrenaline-
pumping chases.
Chapter 13: Gamemastering. This guides GMs
through the nuances of running a game for their
players, including calling for skill tests, using the plot
die, depicting enormous battles, creating a comfort-
able space to explore intense themes and maximize
everyone’s experience, and more.
The Next Step. This presents resources for beginning
a campaign and immersing yourself in the storm-
blasted world of Roshar and the cosmere beyond.
Appendix: Animal Companions. This provides
profiles for Rosharan creatures you can befriend
and work with.
Glossary and Index. These sections summarize
key terms and provide page references for more
information.
Character Sheet. This provides a sheet to keep track
of your character’s statistics, abilities, equipment,
and other information.
```

```
Adapting the Stormlight Archive
In adapting the Stormlight Archive into a tabletop role-
playing game, great care was taken to remain faithful to
Roshar and the cosmere. New lore and powers described
in this book are canonical, developed in close partnership
with Brandon Sanderson. However, a few adjustments
were made to fit the medium of this collaborative game.
For example, some flexible Radiant powers have been
codified into specific mechanical effects; some words
are capitalized differently for clarity; and some lore is
merely hinted at, preserving surprises for new readers
of the novels. This game is simply a foundation to build
on, so choose whichever elements work for you—you’re
embarking on adventures in your Roshar now.
```

recovering, and enjoying extended downtime.
```

**2** Introduction

```
History of Roshar
This section contains significant spoilers for the Stormlight
Archive novels.
In times now lost to memory, long before humankind’s
arrival, indigenous cultures flourished across Roshar.
The singers (as they called themselves) were humanoids
with striking marbled skin and protective carapace.
They could attune to the rhythms of Roshar, connect-
ing profoundly with the enigmatic spren and wielding
magic to change the singers’ forms and powers.
When human refugees arrived first on Roshar, the
singers regarded them with a mix of suspicion and
hospitality, allowing humans to live in the muddy lands
now called Shinovar. However, this uneasy peace was
unraveled by Odium, the god of hatred, who many of
the invading humans had worshipped on their world.
Manipulated by Odium, humans and singers made
war on one another.
Over millennia of escalating conflict, another deity
called Honor opposed Odium’s designs. Both created
immortals—the Fused and the Heralds—to fight their
battles in a series of cataclysmic wars called Desolations.
```

## Welcome to Roshar

```
Wracked by an endless cycle of supernatural storms
and devastated by eons of conflict, Roshar is a harsh
world. Warlike kingdoms vie for superiority, attacking
and oppressing any who dare challenge them, including
their own people. Even the flora and fauna of this planet
are rugged and resilient; many sport tough shells or can
retract into themselves to survive the highstorms that
sweep across the landscape.
But amid this unyielding environment lies great
beauty and power. The highstorms carry Stormlight,
a well of magic that empowers the world and those
who dwell on it. Elements and emotions spring to life
in the form of spren—ethereal beings who fade in and
out of the physical world, affecting it in strange ways.
Flamespren dance around blazing hearths. Painspren
grasp at people suffering from wounds. Gloryspren
shine around those who realize the magnitude of their
accomplishments. Even greater powers lurk in places
less traveled; the heart of the storm and the depths
of lonely valleys hold spren more powerful than most
people could imagine.
```

```
Introduction 3
```

DARKO STOJANOVIC

The turning point came when humans learned to bond
with sapient spren, swearing oaths to unlock the power
of Stormlight. These champions of Honor were called
the Knights Radiant. Human legends tell of malevolent
gods and Voidbringers ravaging the continent, attempt-
ing to erase humankind—and every time, the Radiants
overcame these foes.
But then, for reasons lost to history, two disasters
swept across Roshar. The Radiants gave up their oaths
and forsook their powers. An act of terrible betrayal
struck nearly every singer in Roshar, severing their
Connection to the pure tones of Roshar. Singers entered
a clouded mental state. Humanity was left to fend for
itself, bracing for the next Desolation—but it never
came. Millennia passed, and Radiant powers were all
but forgotten.

```
True Desolation
This section contains significant spoilers for the Stormlight
Archive novels.
For nearly five thousand years, humanity dominated
Roshar. Radiants, spren bonds, and Voidbringers were
nothing but a memory. Humans enslaved the singers,
calling them “parshmen,” and eventually lost all records
of conflict between the two peoples. Instead, the
human nations fought among themselves, embroiled
in generations of endless war.
But powers stir once again. The listeners—the last
of the singers who still rule themselves—have been
driven to a desolate wilderness known as the Shattered
Plains. Desperate, they connected with long-lost powers
and summoned a new storm to rival the highstorm.
This Everstorm freed singers across Roshar, but it also
brought baleful powers from another world. A new
Desolation now besieges humanity, led by the evil
god whose name people fear to speak: Odium.
In the face of this threat, new heroes rise across
Roshar, human and singer alike. Enterprising leaders
coordinate the resistance. Clever artifabrians build
wondrous technologies. Listeners seek a life free from
the influence of Odium’s forces or human oppression.
Agents of mysterious factions work carefully behind
the scenes.
And, most wondrous of all, Radiant spren have begun
to appear once again. By forging new bonds with these
spren, the powers of the surges can once again be used
to defend Roshar. Those who prove themselves worthy
earn the illustrious title of Knights Radiant.
```

```
Er a of Pl ay
The Stormlight setting spans millennia, and groups may
decide to set their campaign at any point in the history
of Roshar. The Stormlight Handbook and Stormlight
World Guide describe the world as it exists during the
True Desolation era, specifically in the year of global war
that follows the events of Oathbringer. However, the
Stonewalkers adventure begins a few months earlier,
parallel to the novel Words of Radiance. It’s up to your
group where your campaign begins; you might explore
another point in the timeline of the novels, or you might
find yourselves thousands of years in the past, during
the original Desolations.

## What Is a Roleplaying Game?

```
A roleplaying game is a collaborative experience
of storytelling and imagination. You and your friends
work together to tell the story of a group of char-
acters, describing their environment, playing out their
conversations, and narrating their actions. You roll
dice to determine whether those actions succeed or
fail, so nobody knows the outcome ahead of time. Each
char acter in the game has unique attributes and rules
that affect these die rolls in different ways. A character
can attempt anything in the game, but the rules mean
some things are more likely to succeed than others.
```

```
Players
As detailed in chapter 1, each player—other than the
game master—creates a character to play throughout
the group’s adventure. Your character is known as a
player character (or PC). They’re unique to you,
and it’s up to you to decide what you want their origins,
ambitions, and decisions to be. Alongside the other
player characters, you form a group—sometimes called
an adventuring party —who’ll (hopefully) stick together
throughout your adventures exploring Roshar. Together,
you might form bonds with powerful spren, face the
forces of Odium, or take on whatever other challenges
your story puts before you.
During the game, you describe the actions your
character takes, roll the dice for their actions when
prompted by the game master, and decide how and
when to use your character’s abilities. How you describe
your character’s actions is up to you. Some players act
out each word and action of their character, while others
prefer to narrate their character’s actions as if they were
telling a story. Do whichever feels best to you.
```

```
Game Master
Most players create and control a single character.
One player, however, takes on the role of the game
master (or GM). They don’t play a single character,
but instead act as the guiding storyteller for your game
experience.
As detailed in chapter 13, the GM is the lead
storyeller and referee of the game. They prepare
an adventure for your group to experience, narrate
the action, and play the roles of each non-player
character (NPC) that PCs encounter, whether friend
or foe. The GM is also responsible for adjudicating the
game’s rules as the story unfolds; as such, it’s important
for the GM to be familiar with all rules of the game,
even those that only apply to player characters.
```

```
GMs, Players, and You
While the GM is certainly a player—after all, you’re
playing a game together—this game’s rules use the word
“player” to specifically refer to participants other than the
GM. Rules for players only apply to anyone who has an
individual player character.
Similarly, when this game refers to “you,” it’s usually
talking specifically to the players. However, some sections
(including the entirety of chapter 13) address the
GM directly.
```

```
Introduction 5
```

ANNA PAZYNIUK

```
What You Need to Play
Besides this rulebook, the players need just a few things
to play this game:
Character Sheet. Each player needs a copy of the
character sheet to track their unique rules and record
what happens to their character during play. You’ll fill
out this sheet during character creation in chapter 1;
you can find a blank sheet in the back of this book or
online at CosmereRPG.com/character-sheets.
Dice. The group needs at least one set of polyhedral
dice (described in the next section). These dice can
be found at hobby stores or online. Additionally, this
game uses a unique plot die with special symbols to
trigger effects during gameplay. You can buy plot dice
online at CosmereRPG.com/shop , or you can designate
an ordinary six-sided die to use in its place (as
described in the upcoming “Plot Die” section).
Pencils and Paper. In addition to pencils for writing
on your character sheet, scratch paper can be helpful
for taking notes or drawing quick sketches to visualize
areas during play.
Safety Tools. Before you play, it’s important to
establish expectations for your group. Tabletop RPGs
can include sensitive material, and safety tools help
players steer the narrative away from topics that make
them feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. Chapter 13,
“Gamemastering,” presents a safety guide to help
your group navigate these areas.
```

```
After a player decides what their character attempts
to do, the GM decides how those actions resolve. Players
are free to make suggestions, but the GM has the final
say on what ultimately happens in the story. The role of
GM is infinitely flexible as they improvise in response
to unexpected player choices and dice rolls.
In this game, the GM isn’t an adversary to the other
players; instead, the GM serves as guide and collab-
orator in creating a story together. It’s true the GM is
responsible for determining which dangers and enemies
PCs face, but the GM’s ultimate goal is to facilitate a
story the whole group finds compelling and satisfying.
```

```
Flow of Play
The game itself is played out in a series of sessions
where your group gathers to play (either in person or
online). Many groups prefer sessions of two to four
hours, but they can be any length you wish. During
a session, gameplay follows this general pattern:
The GM sets the scene. The GM tells you about your
character’s surroundings. They describe the environ-
ment and anything going on that’s easily noticeable.
Depending on the context, they may outline the stakes
of the current scene or describe some options you may
want to pursue.
The players decide what they do. You and the other
players decide what actions your characters take
based on the information. You might investigate
the environment or quickly enact a plan of action.
Sometimes the entire group acts together (such as
“we all head into the stormshelter”). However, your
characters can also act individually, or even split up
between different locations to tackle each aspect of
the situation.
The GM narrates the results. The GM describes the
results of the actions you decided to take. Sometimes
this is as simple as describing a new scene, but when
your attempted actions carry some risk or chance of
failure, the GM might have you roll dice to decide
the outcome. Then, based on those results, the
GM narrates the outcomes, repeating the loop all
over again.
As this cycle continues, the game feels like a casual
conversation; you and the GM go back and forth,
occasionally interjecting a dice roll to see how things
resolve. These steps play out whether you’re negotiating
with a Thaylen merchant, exploring the eerie bottom of
a chasm, or fighting a pitched battle against a greatshell.
To help each situation feel unique, the game presents
special rules for three scene types: combat, conver-
sations, and endeavors (see chapter 9, “Adventuring”).
```

**6** Introduction

```
SAMI RYTKÖNEN
```

**2. Add your skill modifier.** The number next to each
skill on your character sheet is your skill modifier,
reflecting how good you are at that skill. Add it to
your d20 roll.
**3. Add any bonuses or penalties.** Some tests
gain bonuses or penalties in certain circumstances.
Add any of these to your d20 roll.
**4. Compare your total to the test’s difficulty.**
You’re trying to reach a target number known as a
difficulty class (or DC). Add up your d20 roll plus
skill modifiers, bonuses, and penalties; if that result
equals or exceeds the DC, you succeed at your task.
**5. Resolve the results.** Resolve the results of the
success or failure, as well as any side effects triggered
by your abilities or the plot die (described in the
“Plot Die” section).

```
Adding Additional Dice
Some skill tests require adding additional dice to your
d20 roll, such as the following:
Plot Die. On especially important rolls, the GM might
have you add the plot die to introduce Opportunities
or Complications to the story. See the next section.
Advantage or Disadvantage Die. When circumstances
make your test easier (or harder) than usual, you might
roll an extra copy of one or more dice, then pick the
most (or least) beneficial result. See “Advantages and
Disadvantages” in chapter 3.
Damage Die. When you attack an adversary, you add
one or more damage dice to your test, which deter-
mines how powerful your attack is. See “Attacking”
in chapter 10.
Unless otherwise instructed, roll any additional dice at
the same time as your d20.
When an ability requires you to roll multiple dice of
the same kind, this is indicated by a number before the
“d” (such as “3d6”). Roll that number of dice and add
together their results—or if you don’t have that many
dice, you can roll the same die that many times in a row.
For example, if an ability tells you to “roll 3d6,” you roll
three six-sided dice (or roll the same six-sided die three
times) and add their results together.
```

```
Additionally, the GM might use some or all of the
following resources to enhance the game experience:
Stormlight World Guide. The Stormlight Archive
novels describe the rich and deep world of Roshar, but
you can play this game without them. The Stormlight
World Guide (see “The Cosmere RPG” earlier in this
introduction) collects the essential information about
Roshar into a single reference book, complete with
rules and statistics for enemies you can encounter
all over the world.
Adventures. The GM can use the Stormlight World
Guide to design their own custom adventure for your
group to play through. Or if the GM prefers, they can
use official published adventures that provide all the
resources they’ll need to tell the story.
Maps and Miniatures. The Cosmere RPG rules
support “theater of the mind” play, but many players
enjoy visual aids. Miniatures and grid maps can help
track character placement during combat, as described
in the “Variant: Using a Grid” section of chapter 10.
Music. A laptop or speaker with music queued up for
the right moments can add to the atmosphere of a
game table.
```

## Using Cosmere RPG Dice

```
This RPG uses a set of polyhedral dice. In these
sets, each die has a different number of sides: four, six,
eight, ten, twelve, and twenty. This RPG also uses one
additional six-sided die known as the plot die (described
later in this section). Your group needs at least one of
each of these dice to play the game, but most players
prefer to have their own set.
Throughout the rules text, these dice are referred to
by the letter “d” followed by the number of sides of the
die: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. So when you’re told
to roll a d20, find and roll the twenty-sided die.
```

```
Rolling a Skill Test
Whenever the outcomes of your character’s actions
are uncertain, you make a skill test using a d20 to
determine whether you succeed or fail. Tests are the core
mechanic of this game, so you’ll roll them frequently!
The “Skills” section of chapter 3 further details how
skill tests work, but at their most basic, tests follow
these steps:
```

**1. Pick a skill and roll the dice.** Determine which
skill on your character sheet best applies to the situ-
ation, then roll one d20. (You might also need to roll
other dice at the same time as the d20, as described
below in “Adding Additional Dice.”)

```

```
Raising the Stakes
When your character is about to make an important
skill test, the GM can emphasize this by raising the
stakes. When the stakes are raised, roll the plot die
at the same time as you roll your d20 for the test.
The GM might raise the stakes to emphasize
tests like the following:
```

◆ (^) Tests that directly contribute to the current mission.
◆ (^) Tests that play directly to your character’s purpose,
obstacle, or goals.
◆ (^) Other tests with high tension or dramatic import-
ance, as determined by the GM.
The stakes can only be raised once per test, and they
can’t be raised after the d20 has already been rolled.
Plot Die
In addition to normal polyhedral dice, this game uses a
custom die called the **plot die**. You don’t automatically
roll the plot die with every skill test—it’s only used
to “raise the stakes” during tense moments and tests
critical to the plot. NPC tests don’t generally use
the plot die.
When you roll the plot die, the result might add a
bonus to your test—but it can also result in unforeseen
Opportunities or Complications arising from your
actions, as described in the upcoming sections.
The plot die has six sides, two of which are blank.
Another two sides have an Opportunity symbol ( ),
and the final two sides have a Complication symbol
( ). If you don’t own this game’s custom plot die, you
can instead use a normal d6 and convert the results
using the Plot Die diagram. Note that 1 and 2 are the
“worst” results, though they offset the Complication
by granting a bonus to that test (see “Complication
Bonus”). The bonus is equal to the number shown
on the Complication symbol—which is double the
number rolled on a normal d6.

```
Influence the Narrative. Your actions result in a
positive narrative effect of your choice, which the
GM must approve. For example, you might be trying
to rough up a Ghostblood agent; if you fail on your
ultimate goal but roll an Opportunity on that test,
you and your GM might decide you managed to pick
the agent’s pocket while you had your hands on them.
The “Skills” section of chapter 3 suggests example
Opportunities.
Some abilities provide additional ways you can spend
an Opportunity. If an ability says you can spend an
Opportunity to trigger a special effect, but you don’t
roll an Opportunity on that ability’s test, you can’t use
that special effect.
Facing a Complication
When you gain a Complication ,
this applies a negative side effect
to the outcome of your current test
(regardless of whether the test succeeds
or fails). The GM should “spend” this
Complication to choose one of the
following effects:
Hinder an Ally. Your actions have unforeseen
repercussions. The next test taken by a PC gains
a disadvantage (see “Using Skills” in chapter 3).
Become Distracted. You lose 1 focus (see “Focus”
in chapter 3).
Influence the Narrative. Your actions result in a
narrative drawback of the GM’s choice. For example,
you might be trying to deceive a guard into thinking
you’re an important foreign emissary; if you succeed
on your ultimate goal but roll a Complication on that
test, your GM might decide your deception worked
so well that the guard insists on escorting you to their
commander. The “Skills” section of chapter 3 suggests
example Complications.
Some rules provide additional ways the GM can spend
a Complication.
```

```
Complication Bonus
True to its name, a Complication can complicate
a situation—but it can also help your test result!
When you gain a Complication from rolling the plot
die, it also grants you a bonus to your current d
roll. This bonus equals the number displayed inside
the Complication symbol you rolled (either +2 or +4).
If you gain a Complication from another source, it
tells you what bonus to add, if any.
```

# C

Resolving a Plot Die Roll
When you roll the plot die with your test, the effect
depends on whether you roll an Opportunity ( ),
a Complication ( ), or a blank.
If you roll a blank on the plot die, no positive or
negative side effects apply to your test, and you resolve
the remainder of the test as normal. If you roll an or
 symbol, see “Opportunities and Complications.”

Raising the Stakes Yourself
Some abilities give your character the ability to raise the
stakes yourself, though you can only do so if the GM
hasn’t already raised the stakes.
Even if you don’t have one of those abilities, you
might think a test is worthy of raising the stakes. You
can always ask the GM to raise the stakes and advocate
for why you think the test warrants it, but ultimately
it’s the GM’s call. (GMs, see “Using the Plot Die” in
chapter 13 for further guidance on when and how to
raise the stakes.)

Opportunities and

Complications

When you make a test, Opportunities and Compli-
cations represent beneficial or detrimental side effects
related to what happens during the test. These narrative
tools add interesting wrinkles to the story as it unfolds.
Your test can gain an Opportunity or Complication
when you roll the plot die, when an ability grants it, or
when you roll a 20 or 1 on your d20 (see the upcoming
“Opportunity and Complication Ranges” section).

Spending an Opportunity
When you gain an **Opportunity** ,
this applies a beneficial effect to the
out come of your current test (regardless
of whether the test succeeds or fails).
You can “spend” this Opportunity to
choose one of the following effects:

**Aid an Ally.** Thanks to your actions, the next test
made by an ally of your choice gains an advantage
(see “Using Skills” in chapter 3).
**Collect Yourself.** You recover 1 focus (see “Focus”
in chapter 3).
**Critically Hit.** You change a hit into a critical hit
(see “Attacking” in chapter 10). You can only use
this effect on attack tests.

```
Introduction 9
```

```
Opportunity and
Complication Ranges
In addition to the plot die, you can also gain
Opportunities and Complications from a very high
or low d20 roll. When you make a test, you gain an
Opportunity if your d20 rolls a number that falls within
your Opportunity range. By default, this range begins
and ends at 20, so you gain an Opportunity when you
roll a natural 20 —a roll where the die itself shows
the number 20, regardless of the test result after skill
modifiers, bonuses, and penalties.
Similarly, you gain a Complication if your d20 rolls
a number that falls within your Complication range.
By default, this range begins and ends at 1, so you gain
a Complication when you roll a natural 1 —a roll where
the die itself shows the number 1. However, unlike plot
die Complications, this Complication doesn’t grant you
a bonus to your test.
You can gain an Opportunity (or Complication) from
a natural 20 (or natural 1) even when you also rolled
the plot die—so sometimes you might face multiple
Opportunities or Complications on the same test.
```

```
Ranges When Rolling
Multiple D20s
You’ll sometimes roll more than one d20 for a test,
usually due to advantages or disadvantages (see “Using
Skills” in chapter 3). When you do, a d20 only adds an
Opportunity (or Complication) if you (or your GM)
choose that d20 result to apply to your test.
```

```
Expanding D20 Ranges
Some effects expand the range of numbers that add an
Opportunity or Complication to your roll.
If an effect expands your Opportunity range, reduce
its beginning by the stated number. For example, if a
talent expands your Opportunity range by 2 for Crafting
tests, that range becomes 18 through 20—so you now
add an Opportunity on Crafting rolls of a natural 18,
19, or 20.
If an effect expands your Complication range,
increase its end by the stated number. For example,
if a talent expands your Complication range by 3 for
Crafting tests, that range becomes 1 through 4—so you
now add a Complication on Crafting rolls of a natural 1,
2, 3, or 4.
```

```
Stacking Range Expansions
Multiple expansions to Opportunity range, Compli-
cation range, or both can be applied to the same test—
but only if they come from effects with different names
(see “Stacking Talents and Effects” in chapter 4).
For example, if two different effects expand your
Opportunity range by 2 each, you add an Opportunity
if the die shows a 17, 18, 19, or 20.
```

## Actions and Reactions

```
Many of your character’s abilities require you to use
an action or reaction. This game’s rules often refer to
these using special symbols instead of words. You’ll
learn more about actions and reactions in chapter 10,
“Combat,” but here are the basics:
Actions ( ). On your turn in combat, you typically
can use either two or three actions. These can
allow you to do more than one thing on your turn
(for example, moving toward a foe and then attacking
them), or you can combine multiple actions into a
single longer action (for example, using two actions to
Recover lost health). If an ability requires one action,
it’s labeled ; if it requires two actions, it’s labeled ;
and if it requires three actions, it’s labeled.
Reactions ( ). You typically can’t act on other
characters’ turns—but if a specific trigger occurs,
you might use a reaction to immediately respond
in a special way. You typically can use one reaction
between each of your turns.
Free Actions ( ). Some activities don’t require an
action or reaction. For example, you can freely banter
during combat, even if you’ve used all your actions.
```

```
Choosing Opportunities and Complications
When someone adds an Opportunity or a Complication
to their test, everyone else at the table can suggest fun
ways to spend it (such as dramatic narrative outcomes in
your current scene). However, the final choice is up to the
player or GM who is spending it.
If you spend an Opportunity and choose to influence
the narrative, the GM has the final say on if your proposed
narrative effect is possible. If the GM doesn’t approve, you
can work together to pick a new narrative effect, or you
can choose a different effect.
```

```
Stacking Similar Effects
Some effects seemingly overlap with others. In general,
similar effects can stack on a target unless the effects
share the same name. See “Stacking Talents and
Effects” in chapter 4 for the full rules on which effects
stack in this game.
```

```
Minimum of Zero
If an effect tells you to reduce a value, you can’t reduce
it past 0 unless otherwise specified. For example, your
health can’t drop below 0, and you can’t reduce damage
to a negative number.
```

```
Round Down
Whenever you need to divide a value, round down
unless otherwise specified. For example, if your
movement rate is 25 feet and an ability allows you to
“move up to half your movement rate,” you can move
up to 12 feet.
```

## Adventuring and Advancement

```
The stories you tell with the Cosmere RPG can vary
in length and complexity. One group’s adventure might
play out in a single session; these games are often called
one-shots. Another group’s adventure could span
many sessions, forming a lengthy campaign where
the characters grow and advance over time. Some
campaigns might string together many smaller, loosely
connected adventures. Other campaigns could play a
long and elaborate adventure that spans characters’
whole careers.
```

```
Levels and Goals
For groups that play longer adventures, each player
character grows in two ways: through gaining levels
(discussed in the “Character Advancement” section of
chapter 1) and achieving goals (discussed in chapter 8).
Gaining levels represents your growth as you practice
over time; each level allows you to improve your innate
skills and unlock new abilities. Meanwhile, as you pur-
sue and achieve goals unique to your personal narrative,
you gain access to powerful rewards (such as earning
legendary Shardblades or bonding with magical spren).
As your PCs grow in ability and power, your roles
and experiences on Roshar advance and change. Over
time, you’ll progress through five tiers of play (see
“Character Advancement” in chapter 1). These serve
as general guides for what kinds of experiences the PCs
can expect and what kinds of stories the GM should be
trying to tell.
```

## Game Conventions

These general guidelines apply to all rules of the game.

GM Has the Final Say

If there’s ever uncertainty or disagreement about how
to apply the rules of the game, the GM decides.

Specific Beats General

The general rules of the game (such as how to roll dice,
use skills in tests, and engage in combat) provide a
foundation for gameplay. However, many specific rules
granted by characters’ talents, powers, items, or other
elements seemingly “break” the general rules—this
is intentional and adds variety. If a more specific rule
contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

```
Introduction 1111
```

```
Taylor (playing Jhesh): Okay, let’s get a bit more
information before heading down. My Memories of
Stone talent lets me use Cohesion to commune with
the stone of Roshar. I want to find a piece of the ruin’s
stone and lay my hand on it. What can it show me
about what’s happening below?
GM: These stones have been through a lot in recent
months. You’ll need to test Cohesion to interpret
what they show you.
Taylor rolls a d20 and gets a 14 on the roll. Since this is
a Cohesion test, they add their Cohesion modifier of + 5
for a total of 19.
Taylor (playing Jhesh): What do I see with a 19?
GM: Jhesh, you see flashes of the stone being quarried
to form a grand city, then cataclysm, darkness,
peace. This stone was slowly yielding to Roshar’s
embrace until... pickaxes and hammers! You see
singers smashing this stone to open an entrance to
the depths. Regals enter the ruins, their imposing
forms coursing with red lightning, and the singers
unhappily follow. Finally, you see the singers working
deep below—and you see a lone singer standing guard
in the passage just below you.
```

## Example of Play

```
This section presents an excerpt of gameplay from
the middle of an adventure. The PCs have tracked a
group of singers to a location on the Shattered Plains.
Lisiril the Veden Elsecaller (she/her), Jhesh the listener
Willshaper (they/them), and Aj the Iriali Edgedancer
(he/him) prepare to approach the location.
Game Master (GM): An anticipationspren whips at
the air as you approach the spot you scouted. The
Everstorm’s arrival tore apart the plateau’s surface
here. Under the broken layers of crem lie ancient
ruins, exposed for the first time in millennia. A rift in
the ruins leads underground—it’s possible your quarry
headed down there.
Rico (playing Aj): Well, what are we waiting for?
Let’s get in there after them!
GM: Your spren Swillo slithers closer to the entrance
and gives you an admonishing look. “What did we
just learn about rushing in?”
```

**12** Introduction

```
LINDA LITHÉN
```

```
Taylor (playing Jhesh): Wait! I quickly whisper to the
singer, “I was like you once, but I found my own path
to freedom. Tell me: are the Regals holding you against
your will?”
GM: Thanks to your previous Persuasion, she still
trusts you, and she nods as Tempo pulses faster.
Taylor (playing Jhesh): “Don’t worry, we’re
here to help.”
Mia (playing Lisiril): “We are?! Jhesh, you realize
they’re our enemy, right?”
Taylor (playing Jhesh): I glare at Lisiril. “Am I
your enemy?”
GM: The sound of footsteps draws closer and a glowing
red form comes into view. Jhesh and Lisiril, each of
you can do one thing before they’re upon you.
Mia (playing Lisiril): “Storms. Storms. Storms. You get
her out of here, and I’ll distract our company.” I step
from the shadows and stand between Jhesh and the
approaching figure.
Taylor (playing Jhesh): I’m getting this guard out of
here. I grab her and, assuming she follows, we run up
the passage toward Aj.
GM: Jhesh, the singer guard briefly hesitates then follows
you. Lisiril, a glowing red Regal reaches you. You feel
the electricity around them intensifying dangerously.
Mia (playing Lisiril): I wait until the last moment, then
use my Realmic Step talent to pass into Shademar.
I want to use the sea of beads to reach the surface of
the ruins when I step back out—hopefully before the
Regals attack.
GM: Okay, make a DC 15 Transportation test for that.
And raise the stakes again.
Mia rolls a 3 on the d20 for a total of only 7, but she rolls
an  on the plot die.
Mia (playing Lisiril): Uh-oh, that’s a 7. But with an
Opportunity! Can I spend it to at least emerge from
Shadesmar into a shadowy side passage, where they
can’t see me?
GM: Sure! As the Physical Realm reforms around
you, you find yourself hidden in a small side passage
nearer the surface. After you vanish, the Regal yells
and rushes after Jhesh, completely overlooking
your presence.
Taylor (playing Jhesh): Well, it looks like this is
inevitable. I tell the singer guard to keep running
and turn to face the Regals. Mist gathers in my
hand as I summon Tempo as a Shardblade.
GM: Alright, looks like we’re starting a combat.
Who wants to take a fast turn?
The players briefly discuss strategy, and soon,
combat ensues...
```

```
Taylor (playing Jhesh): I attune the Rhythm of
Determination and turn to my companions. “Only
one singer stands watch, away from the others.
They might listen to me as a fellow singer.”
Mia (playing Lisiril): “Alone? Kelek’s breath! That’s
a risk. At least let me sneak inside with you, in case
things go south.”
Taylor (playing Jhesh): I roll my eyes. “You realize
I can heal myself, right? But fine, go in there, but don’t
intervene unless absolutely necessary!” I also tell the
group what I saw about the guard’s positioning.
GM: Alright, Lisiril, make a Stealth test—and you can
make that with an advantage, thanks to the information
Jhesh shared from their vision.
```

_Mia rolls two d20s because she has an advantage; she rolls a
2 on one and a 17 on the other. Since she wants a high roll,
she picks the 17. She then adds her Stealth modifier of + 4
for a total of 21._
**Mia (playing Lisiril):** Phew, your information really
paid off, Jhesh. I got a 21.
**GM:** Lisiril, you carefully stick to the deepest shadows
as you work your way through the ruins. Thanks to
Jhesh’s info, you know to hug the left wall as you near
the chamber; there, a singer guards the far doorway
while quietly humming to a steady rhythm.
**Rico (playing Aj):** Before Jhesh heads down there,
I infuse myself with Abrasion, slicking the bottoms
of my feet so I’m ready to get down there too.
**Taylor (playing Jhesh):** I head down into the ruins.
As I near the guard, I loudly attune the Rhythm of
Peace and raise my hands. “Peace, friend. I only want
to talk, I’m here to help.”
**GM:** The guard jumps at the sight of you, attuning the
Rhythm of the Terrors and grabbing her axe. Test
Persuasion and raise the stakes!

_Taylor rolls a d20 along with the plot die, rolling an 11 on
the d20 and a_ **4** _on the plot die. They add their Persuasion
modifier of +3, along with the +4 from the plot die, for a
total of 18._
**Taylor (playing Jhesh):** Well, that’s an 18, but I got a
Complication.
**GM:** Your words get through to her! She lowers her axe
a bit and her rhythm changes to Anxiety. “Shhh, they’ll
kill you if they spot you. They want to keep what’s here
a secret.” Your spren Tempo hovers over the guard’s
shoulder, pulsing slightly in warning—then the singer
freezes as your Complication comes into play. A shout
echoes from a deeper passage. Red lights dance in the
darkness there. It seems someone heard your exchange!
**Mia (playing Lisiril):** Storms! This is why I’m here.
I’m going to move out of the shadows and...

**Character Creation**

Three Knights Radiant

an unseen threat.

**AA**

```
s you step into the world of Roshar,
you start by creating the character you’ll
embody in the game. From one perspective,
your character is merely a collection of statistics and
abilities that outline what you can do in the rules
of this game. But more importantly, your character
is a concept, a story waiting to be told. You create
everything about them—their wants and needs,
their strengths and weaknesses, their appearance
and personality—forging the beginnings of the story
that defines their place on Roshar.
```

```
Before Character Creation
Before you create your character, imagine who they are.
What sort of person do you want to play? If you’re a
longtime fan of the Stormlight Archive and Roshar, this
might be an incredibly specific idea like “a listener who
serves as keeper of songs.” If you haven’t even touched
the novels, maybe it’s as simple as “a tough-as-nails
mercenary.” There’s no wrong way to approach this
process! You can come up with this concept on your
own, or the group can collaborate on everyone’s
characters. If you need inspiration, consider the iconic
builds in the heroic paths of chapter 4, or think about
the example purposes, obstacles, and goals in chapter 8.
```

```
Telling a Compelling Story
The Stormlight Archive examines journeys of personal
growth. The character you make will change throughout
gameplay, inching ever closer to their destiny. What type
of story feels important, interesting, or healing for you
to tell? As you decide on their challenges and potential
areas of growth, do those parallel things you’re dealing
with in real life? Or are you exploring new topics, hoping
to increase your empathy and understanding through
the process of roleplaying?
```

```
Collaborating on a Story
Before you begin character creation, the GM will let
you know the general theme of your adventure. As you
begin creating your character, make decisions that mesh
with this shared story. For example, if the GM says each
player character is part of the same bridge crew, you
probably shouldn’t create a renowned stormwarden—
unless you and your GM can decide how they’re
connected to the story and its other characters.
```

## Character Creation Steps

```
This section guides you through the eight steps of
character creation:
```

**1.** Choose your origins.
**2.** Choose your starting path.
**3.** Choose your attributes.
**4.** Choose your skills and expertises.
**5.** Choose your talents.
**6.** Equip yourself.
**7.** Tell your story.
**8.** Calculate your final statistics.
While following these steps in order makes your
calculations easiest, some players prefer taking other
approaches. For example, you could start with your
character’s story then fill out the rest of your character
around that concept. To spark inspiration, each heroic
path in chapter 4 includes examples of how you might
use it to build an iconic Stormlight character archetype;
if you’re looking for ideas, that’s a great place to start.
Before starting character creation, make sure you
have a copy of the Cosmere RPG **character sheet** ;
you’ll use this to keep track of your character’s statistics
and unique abilities. You can copy the version at the
back of this book or download and print a sheet from
_CosmereRPG.com/character-sheets_.

```
Starting at Higher Levels
Most characters in this game start at level 1. If your GM
asks your group to create higher-level characters instead,
see “Starting at Higher Levels” in chapter 13.

```
Choosing Your Name
Names hold power. Whenever you’re ready to choose
your character’s name, record both your name and theirs
at the top of your character sheet. Most people’s names
are influenced by the culture they’re raised in, and the
“Culture” section of chapter 2 suggests names for each
culture. However, your character’s name doesn’t have to
be inspired by your culture, and you can choose it in any
way you wish; after all, many people adopt new names
later in life.
```

```
Step 1: Origins
The first step in defining your character is choosing
where you come from, including your ancestry and
culture. As you think about your origins, use the tips
at the beginning of chapter 2 to begin brainstorming
other aspects of your story; you’ll solidify these details
in step 7 of character creation.
```

```
Choose Your Ancestry
You r ancestry represents the species you’re descended
from. In this game, you can choose from the two
most common sapient species on Roshar: humans and
singers. Your ancestry guides your appearance, and
depending on the capabilities of your species, it might
unlock some unique talents.
On Your Character Sheet. Choose one ancestry
from the “Ancestry” section of chapter 2, then write its
name on the front of your sheet. Record that ancestry’s
special rules in their respective fields. (Your ancestry
also grants you one or more bonus talents; you’ll choose
these during step 5 when you gain your other talents.)
Choose Your Culture
Consider the society (or societies) in which you
were raised or have spent the most time. These are
represented by cultural expertises that determine
the languages in which you’re most fluent, grant you
knowledge of how to navigate those societies, and likely
influence your perspective on the world.
On Your Character Sheet. Choose up to two
cultural expertises from the “Culture” section of
chapter 2, then record them on the front of your sheet.
(You’ll learn more about expertises—and possibly gain
more of them—in step 4 of character creation.)

```
Athletics Vigilant Stance: Gain a fighting stance that

```

```
Step 2: Starting Path
Player characters gain most of their abilities from paths ,
reflecting their specialty, training, and experience. Your
character’s chosen paths significantly influence the role
you play in the game. If you’ve played other roleplaying
games, you’re likely familiar with “classes”; paths are
similar but highly flexible.
You begin with a heroic path that grants you
mundane abilities, but as you gain levels, you might
choose a Radiant path and begin wielding Stormlight.
```

```
Choose Your Starting Path
During this step of character creation, you chose
your first heroic path—your starting path. This
book presents six heroic path options in chapter 4:
Agent, Envoy, Hunter, Leader, Scholar, or Warrior.
Each of these is summarized on the Heroic Paths
at a Glance table.
Later, as your character gains levels (and talents),
you can follow that path for as long as you like,
picking new talents from the same talent tree. Or you
can branch into multiple paths—sometimes called
“multi-pathing”—and become as diversified as fits
your story. You might even bond a spren and unlock
a Radiant path from chapter 5!
```

```
On Your Character Sheet. Choose a heroic path
from chapter 4, then record this starting path on the
front of your sheet. (For now, you’re just writing down
the path name, but you’ll gain a skill from this path in
step 4, and you’ll gain at least one talent from this path
in step 5.)
```

```
How Do I Create a Radiant?
Radiants are the most iconic wielders of powerful magical
surges on Roshar. When a human or singer takes special
oaths and bonds their soul with a willing sapient spren,
that person becomes Radiant, able to breathe in and
utilize Stormlight to fuel their powers. Radiants glow with
the Stormlight they breathe in, which increases their
physical abilities, rapidly heals their bodies, and allows
them to manipulate the fundamental forces of nature
through Surgebinding.
If you want to play a Radiant in this game, you certainly
can—but when you first create your character, they aren’t
yet Radiant (unless the GM decides otherwise, such as in a
campaign starting at level 2 or higher). To follow a Radiant
path, your character must first swear Ideals; you’ll work
toward this goal during play, as described in chapter 5.
```

Next, refer to the Movement Rate table in
the “Speed” section of chapter 3, and record the
indicated movement rate on the front of your sheet.
For example, if your Speed is 3, your movement rate
is 30 feet per action.
Next, refer to the Recovery Die table in the
“Willpower” section of chapter 3, and record the
indicated die size on the front of your sheet. For
example, if your Willpower is 2, your recovery
die is a d6.
Finally, refer to the Senses Range table in
the “Aware ness” section of chapter 3, and record
the indicated range on the front of your sheet.
For example, if your Awareness is 3, you can easily
sense up to 20 feet even when your primary sense
is obscured.
```

```
Step 4: Skills and Expertises
The next step is to consider what skills and expertises
your character has honed, regardless of their innate
attributes.
Gain a Starting Skill Rank
The starting path you chose in step 2 grants an
associated starting skill , which is considered central
to characters who start on that path.

your path’s starting skill (listed on the earlier Heroic
Paths at a Glance table, and also in the path’s “Key
Talent” section in chapter 4). On the front of your
sheet, mark a checkbox next to this skill.
```

```
Choose Your Skills
As you play the game, you’ll frequently use skills
(detailed in chapter 3) to attempt various tasks. You
might sneak past enemy lines with a Stealth test, or
you might forage in the wilderness with a Survival test.
You could’ve gained these skills through your education,
line of work, or personal experience. You might even
attribute some to supernatural events.
The more ranks you have in a skill, the better you
are at tests and abilities that use that skill. Each skill is
also enhanced by the attribute listed next to it on your
character sheet. This combination of skill ranks plus
attribute score determines your skill modifier , which
you add to your test result; this reflects how effectively
you can perform various skill tests. For example, you’re
more likely to succeed on Insight tests if you also have
high Awareness.
On Your Character Sheet. Distribute 4 more
ranks among the eighteen skills listed on the front of
your character sheet, marking a checkbox for each
rank. You can’t increase any skill above 2 ranks during
```

```
Step 3: Attributes
Your character’s innate characteristics are represented
by six attributes : Strength, Speed, Intellect, Willpower,
Awareness, and Presence. These form the foundation
for your skills, physical and mental limits, and more,
as detailed in chapter 3.
```

```
Choose Your Attributes
Consider which attributes best represent your strengths.
Most humans and singers have attribute scores
ranging from 0 to 5—the higher your score, the more
exceptional you are in that area. When you gain levels,
you can increase your attribute scores even further.
On Your Character Sheet. Distribute 12 points
across the six attributes in any order. You don’t have
to put points in every attribute—0 is a valid attribute
score—and you can’t put more than 3 points into
any attribute during this step of character creation.
For example, you might choose a distribution of
0, 3, 2, 3, 3, and 1.
Record each chosen attribute score on the front of
your character sheet. For now, ignore the nearby boxes
for your defenses, health, focus, and Investiture; you’ll
calculate these statistics in step 7.
Record Related Statistics
Your attribute scores determine how good you are
in related areas, including (but not limited to) the
following:
```

◆ (^) Your Strength determines your **lifting capacity** ,
representing the heaviest weight you can lift.
◆ (^) Your Speed determines your **movement rate** ,
representing how fast and far you can move
under pressure.
◆ (^) Your Willpower determines your **recovery die** ,
representing how efficiently you recover health
and focus.
◆ (^) Your Awareness determines your **senses range**.
When your primary sense is overwhelmed (such
as in a thunderous highstorm or a lightless room),
your senses range determines how far away you can
perceive using other faculties (such as smell, touch,
or intuition).
While your Intellect and Presence are just as import-
ant as the above attributes, you don’t need to record
anything about them on your character sheet right now.
**On Your Character Sheet.** First, refer to the
Lifting and Carrying Capacity table in the “Strength”
section of chapter 3, and record the indicated lifting
capacity on the front of your sheet. For example, if your
Strength is 2, your lifting capacity is 200 pounds.

```
Chapter 1: Character Creation 19
```

```
Step 5: Talents
Your path allows you to pick talents from a tree of
options each time you gain a level. Each talent grants
you a benefit or ability, representing the specialized
capabilities that set you apart from other characters.
```

```
Gain Your Key Talent
In step 2, you chose a starting path, which determines
your first talent. This key talent is an important ability
that other talents in the path may further improve on.
On Your Character Sheet. You gain the first talent
in your starting path, as detailed at the top of that path’s
talent tree. Record this talent on the front of your sheet.
Choose an Ancestry Talent
In step 1, you chose an ancestry that grants you one or
more bonus talents.
If you’re a singer, you gain Change Form plus one
talent that grants you starting forms (see “Choosing
Singer Ancestry” in chapter 2).
If you’re a human, you gain another talent from
a heroic path (see “Choosing Human Ancestry” in
chapter 2). You can choose another talent within your
existing path or choose the first talent of another path.
On Your Character Sheet. Following the rules in
the “Ancestry” section of chapter 2, choose your bonus
talent(s) and record them on the front of your sheet. If a
talent affects your other statistics, also record those in
the appropriate fields.
```

```
Step 6: Equipment
To reflect your character’s background and interests,
you gain a starting kit with equipment, currency, and
other resources. Some kits also have intangible benefits
like granting you a bond with a patron (discussed in
chapter 8) or jump-starting your journey to becoming
a Radiant (discussed in chapter 5).
```

```
Choose Your Starting Kit
Each character begins with a starting kit from chapter 7.
Your story isn’t bound by the names of each kit, so pick
any kit you wish, then decide how you came to possess
these items and resources. For example, if you pick the
Courtier kit, perhaps you inherited these items from
your noble Alethi family—or perhaps you illicitly gained
them from your criminal career in Thaylen City.
On Your Character Sheet. Choose a starting
kit from chapter 7, then record its contents in the
corresponding fields of your sheet (such as “Weapons”
or “Armor & Equipment”).
```

```
character creation, but you can otherwise choose them
however you wish. (If you choose 2 ranks in a skill,
mark two checkboxes by it.)
After you distribute these ranks, calculate your skill
modifiers for each skill, even those you have no ranks in.
Your skill modifier equals:
your number of ranks in that skill + your score for that
skill’s attribute + any bonuses or penalties
Record each skill modifier in the box to the left of that
skill. For example, if you have 2 ranks in Insight and
your Awareness is 3, your Insight modifier is +5.
```

```
Choose Your Expertises
Beyond concrete skills, your character has several areas
of expertise —very specialized knowledge from personal
experience. You might have intricate knowledge of one
kind of weapon, years of learning about an academic
subject, or deep familiarity with a given culture.
Each expertise is a simple word or phrase repre-
senting a subject you specialize in. If your character
is combat-focused, you’ll likely want to choose your
favorite weapon or armor as an expertise. If you’re
interested in crafting, consider expertises on creating
fantastical items such as fabrials. If you’re a scholar,
consider cultural expertises that reflect your expanded
knowledge about the world.
As detailed in chapter 3, your expertise grants you
various benefits; for example, if you have an expertise
in Engineering, you might automatically know if it’s safe
to cross a rickety bridge, while another character would
have to test Deduction to come to the same conclusion.
On Your Character Sheet. You already gained
two expertises when you picked your culture in step 1 of
character creation. If your Intellect score is 1 or higher,
you can now choose additional expertises equal to that
score, recording them on the front of your sheet.
The “Expertises” section of chapter 3 suggests
potential subjects, but you can choose an expertise
on nearly any subject you can imagine.
```

```
Special Skills
All characters can use the eighteen skills listed on the
character sheet. However, you might gain additional skills
during play, representing your practice with surges (see the
“Using Surges” section of chapter 6) or other fantastical
elements of the cosmere. If you later gain an additional
skill, record it on the blank lines at the end of the skill list.
```

**20** Chapter 1: Character Creation

```
Your goals not only define what currently drives
you, but they grant you access to powerful items, people,
and resources during your adventures. As described in
chapter 8, when you accomplish a goal, you unlock a
reward. These can include possessions (like fabrials or
Shardplate), relationships (like traveling companions or
patrons), increased status (like noble titles), and more.
On Your Character Sheet. Create one or two goals
to start with, following the guidance in the “Goals”
section of chapter 8. Record these goals on the back
of your sheet.
For now, ignore the checkboxes to the right of each
goal. As the game progresses, you’ll use these to mark
your progress toward your goals.
```

```
Purchase More Equipment
If your kit grants you marks (Roshar’s common cur-
rency), you can use these to purchase more equipment
if you wish (or you can save the marks for later). You
can buy any of the weapons, armor, or equipment listed
in chapter 7—but pay attention to the prices! As a
starting character, much of the equipment is beyond
your means.
On Your Character Sheet. If you purchase extra
equipment, record it in the corresponding fields of
your sheet.
```

```
Record Your Deflect Value
Some armor reduces the effect of impact, keen, and
energy damage (see “Deflect” in chapter 3). Your
deflect value determines how much of that damage
you can ignore.
On Your Character Sheet. If you gained armor
during this step, record its deflect value on the front of
your sheet. Otherwise, your deflect is probably 0.
```

```
Step 7: Story
You now know your abilities, and you have an idea of
what experiences shaped you. Now it’s time to solidify
who you were leading up to this moment, and even
more importantly, who you are today.
Choose Your Purpose and Obstacle
You r purpose is your soul and reason for being. It
doesn’t have specific mechanical effects; rather, your
purpose is what drives you, what defines you, and what
inspires you to the lofty goals of your adventures ahead.
You r obstacle , on the other hand, is what stands
in the way of your purpose, time and time again. This
could be pride, impulsiveness, greed, or anything else
that keeps you from your full potential.
On Your Character Sheet. Choose a purpose
and at least one obstacle, following the guidance in the
“Purpose and Obstacle” section of chapter 8. Record
these choices on the back of your sheet.
```

```
Choose Your Goals
The tangible objectives your character is personally
working toward during their adventures are represented
by goals. These are a critical part of your character and
how they advance in this game, so think about them
carefully. Each goal should be something you’re trying
to accomplish in the game; this might be as immediate
as “escaping imprisonment” or as lofty as “swearing an
Ideal of the Knights Radiant.”

Tell Your Story
By now, you probably have a good idea of not only what
your character is, but who they are. Feel free to add
details to your story, referring back to “Considering
Your Origins” at the beginning of chapter 2. Consider
details such as the following:

**Occupation.** What do you do for a living? Is it leading
you into your adventures or distracting you from them?
**Relationships.** Who are the most important—or
troublesome—people in your life? What factions
are you allied with or at odds with? If you have few
connections, is there a reason you prefer to work alone?
And importantly, how do you know the other player
characters, if at all? (Work with your GM and the
other players to create connections to them.)
**Loyalties.** Has your loyalty to your friends or factions
ever conflicted with your values or goals? For
example, perhaps you’re a middling member of the
Diagram who once believed you were helping save
humankind, but now you grapple with the depravity
of your missions.
**Personality.** Your character’s personality will solidify
as you play the game, but you can sketch it out now.
What are your preferences, dislikes, quirks, and general
disposition? Do you take joy in the finer things and
find poor lodgings an insufferable burden? Or are
you frugal, refusing to overspend or be swindled?
What makes you stand out from others who share
your ancestry, culture, and occupation?
**Appearance.** What are your distinctive features?
What fashions appeal to you? How tall are you?
You can record your description in the “Character
Appearance” field on your character sheet.
**Possible Radiant Order.** Do you want your character
to eventually join a Radiant order? If so, consider
harmonizing your story and personality with a specific
Order’s tenets, preparing to bond the corresponding
type of spren when the opportunity arises.

You don’t need to know everything about your character
when you begin your adventures; feel free to keep things
flexible and let more of their story emerge during play.

```
Step 8: Final Calculations
Congratulations, you’ve made all the big decisions!
As the final step of character creation, use the
instructions in this section to calculate and record
your remaining statistics. Chapter 3 details how your
attributes affect these and other aspects of the game.
As you do so, be sure to apply any bonuses from
your talents, equipment, and other effects. For example,
the Collected talent increases both your Cognitive
defense and Spiritual defense by 2.
```

```
Calculate Resource Pools
During your adventures, you draw from three resource
pools, each of which has a maximum value that you’ll
regularly deplete and recover during play (see “Health,
Focus, and Investiture” in chapter 3).
Health
This physical resource represents your stamina and
resistance to minor injuries, and it increases as you level
up. At level 1, your maximum health equals:
10 + your Strength attribute + any bonuses or penalties
Record your maximum health on the front of your sheet,
then record the same number for your current health.
For example, at level 1, if your Strength is 2 and you
have no relevant talents or other effects, your maximum
and current health are 12.
Focu s
This cognitive resource represents mental resolve
and ability to resist distraction and emotional distress.
Your maximum focus equals:
2 + your Willpower attribute + any bonuses or penalties
Record your maximum focus on the front of your sheet,
then record the same number for your current focus.
For example, if your Willpower is 2 and you have no
relevant talents or other effects, your maximum and
current focus are 4.
Investiture
As a new character, you don’t have this spiritual
resource yet. If you later gain Investiture (see chapter 5),
your Awareness or Presence affects it.
```

```
Chapter 1: Character Creation 23
```

```
Calculate Defenses
Your three defenses represent your resilience against
attacks, coercion, and other unwanted effects. The
higher your defenses, the harder it is for opponents to
succeed on skill tests against you (see the “Defenses”
section of chapter 3). Record your three defenses on
the front of your sheet:
Physical Defense. Your Physical defense equals
10 + your Strength attribute + your Speed attribute +
any bonuses or penalties. For example, if your Strength
is 2 and your Speed is 3, and you have no relevant
talents or other effects, your Physical defense is 15.
Cognitive Defense. Your Cognitive defense equals
10 + your Intellect attribute + your Willpower
attribute + any bonuses or penalties. For example,
if your Intellect is 2 and your Willpower is 2, your
Cognitive defense is 14.
Spiritual Defense. Your Spiritual defense equals
10 + your Awareness attribute + your Presence
attribute + any bonuses or penalties. For example,
if your Awareness is 3 and your Presence is 0,
your Spiritual defense is 13.
```

```
Complete Other Fields
Only a few more fields remain on your character sheet:
Level. On the front of your sheet, record that your
character is level 1. This reflects your current power
and experience; you’ll gain levels as you continue
your adventures in the cosmere. (See the “Character
Advancement” section of this chapter.)
Conditions & Injuries. For now, you don’t have
any active conditions. You’ll use this field to track
temporary effects you experience during gameplay
(see “Conditions” and “Injuries” in chapter 9).
Notes. You can use this field to keep track of any-
thing you wish.
Connections. During your adventures, you’ll use this
field to track the special connections you build with
NPCs and factions. Unless you gained a connection
earlier in character creation, this field should remain
blank for now. (See “Connections” in chapter 8.)
Play the Game!
With your character sheet completed, you’re ready
to play!
```

## Character Advancement

```
During this game, your character will face adventure
and adversity, making friends and foes alike. As you
do, you’ll advance in two meaningful ways. First, you’ll
earn rewards for completing personal goals; these can
grant you powerful items, allies, and abilities, as detailed
in chapter 8. Second, as your campaign progresses,
your GM will indicate that your collaborative story has
reached certain milestones. When this happens, each
character gains a level, representing that each of you has
reached a significant milestone in skill and experience.
```

```
Tiers of Play
The levels you advance through are divided into five
tiers. As your adventuring party grows in power and
faces more dangerous foes, each tier presents a slightly
different play experience:
Tier 1 (Levels 1–5). Characters are just coming
into their powers and learning about their place on
Roshar. You’re dealing with issues and threats on a
personal scale that affect you and the people around
you. Your decisions may attract a spren to bond with
your character, eventually granting you access to
powerful surges.
Tier 2 (Levels 6–10). Characters begin dealing with
higher-stakes issues on Roshar. At this point, some
characters have likely gained talents in the powerful
Radiant paths and sworn multiple Ideals. Other char-
acters may have earned Shardblades of their own.
Tier 3 (Levels 11–15). Characters begin facing
challenges on a scale that impacts all of Roshar.
You might be fighting Fused or other powerful
adversaries, and some characters may have earned
a set of Shardplate.
Tier 4 (Levels 16–20). Characters face challenges
not just on Roshar, but potentially stretching into
the greater cosmere. Though you’ve largely mastered
your powers, you now face otherworldly foes and
unfamiliar threats.
Tier 5 (Level 21+). After level 20, you’ve embraced your
identity, your powers, and your destiny. At this point,
you might be leading the struggle against cosmere-level
threats—or you might retire to a life of peace after a
job well done.
Your character’s tier primarily impacts the scope of
your current adventures, but it also affects a few of
your statistics. For example, you gain ancestry talents
at the beginning of each tier; your maximum skill rank
increases along with your tier; and some of your talents
may become more powerful.

```

```
Gaining a Level
When you gain a level (sometimes known as “leveling
up”), your power and abilities increase, as indicated
on the Character Advancement table in this section.
Follow these steps to advance your character:
```

**1.** Increase your character level by 1.
**2.** If indicated for this level, increase an attribute
and its related statistics.
**3.** Increase your health.
**4.** Gain skill ranks.
**5.** Gain a new talent.

```
Step 1: Increase Your Level
Your character starts the game at level 1, and you
gain a level when your adventure reaches a milestone
as indicated by your GM.
Step 2: Increase an Attribute
At levels 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, increase one attribute
of your choice by 1, as indicated on the Character
Advancement table. (No other levels grant an attribute
increase.) You can’t increase any attribute above 5 in
this way, but some talents may temporarily boost your
attributes, which doesn’t count toward this limit.
On your character sheet, be sure to update skill
modifiers and other statistics affected by this attribute;
the “Attributes” section of chapter 3 tells you what to
recalculate for each attribute.
```

```
Step 3: Increase Your Health
Increase both your maximum and current health by
the amount specified for your level on the Character
Advancement table.
Step 4: Gain Skill Ranks
Each time you gain a level (through level 20), you
gain 2 skill ranks of your choice. From level 21 onward,
you gain your choice of either a skill rank or a talent
(see step 5), not both, as indicated on the Character
Advancement table.
```

```
You can’t have more ranks in a skill than the
maximum skill rank for your tier, as shown in the
Max Skill Rank column of the Character Advancement
table. However, some talents may temporarily boost
your skills, which doesn’t count toward this limit.
Beyond the above limitations, you can distribute
these new skill ranks among any skills you wish,
including surge skills gained from Radiant paths.
On your character sheet, for each skill rank
you gain, mark one checkbox next to that skill
and increase its modifier by 1.
Step 5: Gain a Talent
Each time you gain a level (through level 20), you gain
one talent. From level 21 onward, you gain your choice
of either a skill rank (see step 4) or a talent, not both,
as indicated on the Character Advancement table.
Additionally, your ancestry grants you a bonus talent
at the beginning of each tier (levels 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21);
the “Ancestry” section of chapter 2 details which bonus
talents are available to your ancestry.
Whenever you choose a talent, you must meet its
prerequisites (as described in the next section).
```

```
Prerequisites
Some abilities—usually talents—have prerequisites
you must meet before selecting or benefiting from them.
For example, you might need to swear an Ideal or gain
more ranks in a skill before you’re allowed to choose a
particular talent. Additionally, each talent (other than
a key talent) requires you to have the talent preceding it
in the talent tree, as described in “Advancing Through
a Path” in chapter 3.
Some effects permanently increase your statistics,
and these count toward such prerequisites. However,
if you gain a temporary bonus from talents, fabrials,
and similar effects, this doesn’t count toward prereq-
uisites. For example, if you’re a singer in artform,
your Awareness temporarily increases—but because
that bonus ends when you change forms, it doesn’t
count toward prerequisites that require a certain
Awareness score.
```

**26** Chapter 1: Character Creation

```
Choosing Rewards
As your character advances, you’ll complete
goals that allow you to choose special rewards
(see chapter 8, “Goals and Rewards”). You may
wish to think in advance and talk to your GM about
what rewards you want to work toward. If your
character becomes a Radiant, you’ll likely spend most
of your rewards on strengthening your spren bond
and swearing Ideals—but this diverts your attention
from growing your status, resources, and strategic
affiliations. So while Radiant characters tend to earn
more impressive personal power, heroic characters
tend to secure monumental connections and key
assets to dominate their enemies and write them selves
into legend.

CORE RULEBOOK VERSION CORE RULEBOOK VERSION

**YY**

```
our character’s life story begins long
before your game does. You certainly don’t
need to write an epic novel about this
backstory, but your campaign will feel more meaningful
if you have a basic idea of where your character is
coming from (and how they might be connected to the
other player characters). This chapter helps you build
that foundation, including some choices that are purely
for flavor, and others that significantly impact your
game statistics.
```

```
Considering Your Origins
As you begin character creation, think about the
winding path that led your character to the moment
your adventures start. Who and where do they come
from? What have they spent their time learning, either
voluntarily or under duress? How does their personality
inform their interests? Most importantly, what story
do you want to set up with their origins? During step 7
of character creation, you’ll solidify these details,
but thinking about them now can inspire your other
character-building decisions.
Most enjoyable and fulfilling stories tend to focus
less on the cool things a character can do, and more on
the sacrifices they make and challenges they overcome
to accomplish those cool things. Whether your char acter
is destined to bond a spren and become a Knight
Radiant, or whether they’ll achieve greatness all on their
own, their past likely includes some degree of hardship
and perseverance. Keeping that in mind, it’s time to
start crafting your character’s story, beginning with
their origins.
```

```
Ancestry and Culture
During the first step of character creation, you choose
your ancestry and the cultures that shaped you. The
later sections of this chapter detail these choices and
how they impact the rules of this game.
```

```
Story Considerations
You’ll decide more about your story during step 7 of
character creation, but you can start considering the
following factors now. These don’t affect your game
statistics, but they certainly shape who you are and
how you respond to your adventures.
```

```
Occupation
Depending on your character’s age and ability, you
might decide on a past or present occupation. This
experience doesn’t have to directly tie to your decisions
or role in the party, but if you wish, it can inform many
decisions. For example, your occupation might influence
your later choice of talents. Your choice of starting
equipment might reflect your occupation. And when
you have a break between adventures, you might even
ply your trade to earn spheres (see “Downtime”
in chapter 9).
Remember, your experience and prowess should
correspond to your level. A 1st-level character wouldn’t
yet be a battalionlord (see “Titles” in chapter 8), but
you could tend a stable of royal Ryshadium with the
appropriate expertise.
Identity
Your occupation might be part of your past, but you
carry much of your identity with you wherever you go.
How old are you? What’s your gender identity? Do you
belong to any groups (by circumstance or by choice)
that you consider part of your core identity?
```

```
Friends and Factions
No one is an island. Consider which relationships have
most shaped you. This might include family (and chosen
family), old friends, trusted colleagues, bitter rivals,
and more. Is there anyone you’re responsible for, owe a
debt to, or grieve? In addition to individual people, what
factions do you owe allegiance to? Are you connected to
any governments, religions, guilds, armies, crime rings,
or secret organizations?

Human Ancestry
Most of Roshar is divided into human-ruled nations
with majority-human populations.
Many ethnic groups are represented within the
human species, some of which include distant singer
ancestry. Although each ethnic group shares common
physical characteristics among many of its people, these
characteristics can express themselves very differently
across individuals. Due to the Vorin “right of travel,”
international relations, and diasporas born of conflict,
most nations have some degree of ethnic diversity
among citizens.
The “Culture” section of this chapter discusses the
nations of Roshar and the most common ethnicities of
the people who live there.
```

```
Choosing Human Ancestry
If you choose the human ancestry , your size is
Medium, and you gain the following benefits at the
specified levels:
Ancestry Bonus Talents (Level 1, 6, 11, 16, and
21). During step 5 of character creation, you gain
one bonus talent. As a human, you must choose this
talent from a heroic path (such as those in chapter 4).
Whenever you reach a new tier (as indicated on the
Character Advancement table in chapter 1), you again
gain a bonus talent from a heroic path.
As usual, you must meet the prerequisites for these
talents (see the “Advancing Through a Path” section
of chapter 4).
```

```
Singer Ancestry
Singers are the indigenous population of Roshar,
though this knowledge was suppressed by the humans
and lost for many Desolations. Singers can change
forms by bonding spren during highstorms, altering
the singer’s appearance and abilities. Their intellectual
and emotional capacities are equal to those of humans—
but unlike humans, whose abilities generally remain
constant, singer forms have the remarkable ability
to temporarily amplify some abilities while others
lie dormant.
Singers have skin marbled with black, white, or
red. Singer hairstrands range in hue, including orange,
red, and black. Protective carapace covers parts of their
bodies, though certain forms have more substantial
carapace, acting as biological armor. When a singer
takes on a new form, it can influence their physicality,
aspects of their personality, and their access (or lack
thereof ) to certain rhythms.
```

## Ancestry

You r **ancestry** reflects who you’re descended from.
When you choose an ancestry in step 1 of character
creation, this affects your identity and general appear-
ance, determines your size (see “Size and Space” in
chapter 10), and grants you talents or other abilities
to represent unique traits of your species.
Though your ancestry may be an important part
of your identity, it doesn’t define you. In a later section,
you’ll choose the culture and society you were raised in,
and possibly a different one you embrace today. These
significantly impact how you view the world and what
you want for yourself, which might completely diverge
from what others expect of you.
This section details the two species of sapient
humanoids who live on Roshar: humans and singers.

```
GAL OR
```

```
Singers use these rhythms—which suffuse all of
Roshar—to add emotional context and depth to their
words. Though most humans can’t comprehend the
rhythms, singers associate rhythms with specific
emotions. Each singer imbues their words with a
cadence representing their mood. With concentration,
they can even attune a false rhythm; sometimes singers
do this to correct themselves, and other times, to
mislead their audience. For example, a singer might
attune the Rhythm of Peace to lessen their own
anxiety—or hum to the Rhythm of Consideration to
pretend they’re paying close attention to an argument
they find boring. Other examples of common rhythms
include the Rhythm of Determination, the Rhythm
of the Terrors, the Rhythm of Joy, and the Rhythm
of the Lost.
```

```
The “Culture” section of this chapter describes the
listeners—a culture of singers—and also summarizes
the experiences of other singers who live in human-
ruled lands. You can learn even more about singers
in chapter 2 of the Stormlight World Guide.
Choosing Singer Ancestry
If you choose the singer ancestry , your size is
Medium, and you gain the following benefits at the
specified levels:
Unique Talent Tree (Level 1). Whenever you choose
a new talent, you can choose it from the Singer talent
tree in this chapter (in addition to the other trees you
have access to).
Change Form (Level 1). You gain the Change Form
(Singer Key) talent from the Singer tree, along with
one bonus talent that’s connected to it. Decide which
form to begin the game in, choosing from the forms in
these two talents. As you gain levels, you can learn new
forms from talents in the Singer tree.
Ancestry Bonus Talents (Level 6, 11, 16, and 21).
Each time you reach a new tier (as indicated on the
Character Advancement table in chapter 1), you again
gain a bonus talent. You must choose it from the Singer
tree or from any heroic path (see chapter 4).
As usual, you must meet the prerequisites for these
talents (see the “Advancing Through a Path” section
of chapter 4).
```

```
Singer Talents
The following talents are available to characters with
singer ancestry. See “Using Talents” in chapter 4 for
information on how to read and use these talents.
```

```
Change Form (Singer Key)
Prerequisite: Singer ancestry
Activation:
You learn to bond a spren during highstorms and change
your form. This transformation alters not only your
appearance, but your physical, cognitive, and spiritual
strengths, and even your personality.
When you acquire this talent, you begin with
two singer forms, dullform and mateform:
Dullform. Your form isn’t specialized, as your bonded
spren grants no form. You can pass unnoticed as a
“parshman” in most human societies, but you don’t
gain other benefits from your form.
Mateform. You have bonded with a lifespren, and your
form is specialized for reproduction.

```
While outdoors during a highstorm, you can activate
this talent either to change into dullform, or to take a
spren into your gemheart and change into mateform
or any form you’ve unlocked on the Singer talent tree.
The type of spren bonded determines your new form.
In most circumstances, you can automatically find and
bond the type of spren required for that form. However,
if the GM determines that current circumstances make
the spren difficult to locate, you might need to roleplay
or succeed on a test to do so.
While in a form, you temporarily gain its actions,
statistic increases, and other effects (even if this temp-
orarily increases your statistics above the maximum);
these effects only last until you assume a different
form by using this talent again. You can only be in
one form at a time.
```

```
Forms of Finesse
Prerequisite: Change Form key talent
Activation:
You gain two new singer forms—artform and nimble-
form—which you can transform into using your
Change Form.
Artform
Artform specializes in creative expression. You gain a
heightened awareness of the rhythms, colors, and other
aspects of the world around you. If you have carapace,
it’s purely cosmetic, representing radical self-expression.
You’ve bonded with a creationspren. While in this form,
you increase your Awareness by 1, and you gain utility
expertises in Painting and Music.
Additionally, you gain an advantage on Crafting tests
and on tests related to entertaining, such as singing
and dancing.
Nimbleform
Nimbleform specializes in physical and mental flexibility.
Your protective carapace is minimal; instead, you have
an increased range of motion and mental focus.
You’ve bonded with a windspren. While in this form,
your Speed increases by 1. When you change into this
form, your maximum focus and current focus both
increase by 2, and when you assume a different form,
both decrease by 2.
```

```
Forms of Resolve
Prerequisite: Change Form key talent
Activation:
You gain two new singer forms—warform and
work form—which you can transform into using
your Change Form.
Warform
Warform specializes in combat, increasing your strength
and stamina. Your body is large and covered with fierce
carapace, which protects you like armor. Any aversions
you might usually have to violence, pain, and death
become slightly less pronounced in warform.
You’ve bonded with a painspren. While in this form,
your Strength increases by 1 and your deflect value
increases by 1. This deflect doesn’t stack with armor,
so if you wear armor over your carapace, choose
which value to use.
Additionally, when you move, you can jump a
horizontal distance up to your movement rate, or
a vertical distance up to half your movement rate,
without succeeding on an Athletics test.
```

ANTHONY AVON (LEFT); KATIE PAYNE (RIGHT)

```
Workform
Workform specializes in labor. This form helps you see
tasks through to completion, granting you determination
and stamina. You have a rugged body with modest
carapace ridges.
You’ve bonded with a gravitationspren. While in this
form, your Willpower increases by 1, and you ignore
the effects of the Exhausted condition.
Additionally, you can easily disguise yourself to pass
unnoticed as a “parshman” in most human societies,
though people might begin noticing the differences in
your form if you’re caught doing anything suspicious.
Forms of Wisdom
Prerequisite: Change Form key talent
Activation:
You gain two new singer forms—mediationform and
scholarform—which you can transform into using your
Change Form.
Mediationform
Mediationform specializes in communication, whether
you’re connecting with new people or teaching those you
know well. Your carapace is smooth, and your facial
features are well-defined and expressive.
You’ve bonded with a bindspren. While in this form,
your Presence increases by 1.
Additionally, you don’t have to spend focus to use
the Aid reaction.
Scholarform
Scholarform specializes in scholarship, enhancing your
mental processes and memory. You become more patient
and analytical, but you may also find yourself more
inclined toward ambition. You have long hairstrands,
and a cushioned lower body suited to sedentary work.
You’ve bonded with a logicspren. While in this form,
your Intellect increases by 1.
Additionally, when you adopt this form, choose
one cultural or utility expertise you don’t already have,
and choose one cognitive skill that isn’t a surge skill.
You temporarily gain that expertise, and you tempor-
arily gain an additional rank in that skill.
If you gain the Erudition talent from the Scholar
path, the expertise and skill rank you gain from your
scholarform count as being granted by Erudition; when
Erudition allows you to reassign expertises and skills,
your scholarform expertise and skill are also eligible for
reassignment. You can’t choose the same skill for both
scholarform and Erudition.
```

**scholarform**

**workform**

**34** Chapter 2: Origins

KATIE PAYNE
```

```
You’ve bonded with a stormspren, a type of Void spren.
While in this form, your Strength increases by 1, your
Speed increases by 1, and your deflect value increases
by 1. This deflect doesn’t stack with armor, so if you wear
armor over your carapace, choose which value to use.
Additionally, you can use Unleash Light ning:
Unleash Lightning. Your body crackles with the Ever-
storm’s unnatural red lightning, which you can unleash in a
violent arc. Spend 1 focus or 1 Investiture to make a ranged
Discipline attack against the Physical defense of a target
within 60 feet of you. Roll 2d8 energy damage. On a hit,
the target is also Disoriented until the end of their next turn.
If you have recently taken on stormform, the GM might raise
the stakes on this attack due to the unpredictability of the
arcing lightning.
As you gain ranks in Discipline, the size of this attack’s
damage dice increases: at 4 ranks, you roll 2d10 damage
(instead of 2d8), and at 5 ranks or more, you roll
2d12 damage.
```

```
Ambitious Mind
Prerequisite: Discipline 3+; either the Forms
of Finesse, Forms of Resolve, or Forms of
Wisdom talent
Activation:
Your growing thirst for power opens you to the influence
of Odium.
Though you haven’t yet bonded a Voidspren, Odium’s
influence seeps into your mind, and your Cognitive
defense increases by 2.
If you later acquire a talent that grants you forms of
power, you can then use your Change Form to attract
a Voidspren. Bonding with this Voidspren follows the
same rules as taking other forms.
While bonded with a Voidspren, you become
vulnerable to its influence; once per day when you gain
a Complication on a test, you must succeed on a DC 15
Discipline test or become Stunned until the end of
your next turn as you struggle against the Voidspren’s
influence. You automatically succeed on this test if
you’ve sworn the First Ideal of a Radiant order.
```

```
Forms of Destruction
Prerequisite: Ambitious Mind talent
Activation:
You gain two new forms of power—direform and
stormform—which you can transform into using
your Change Form.
Direform
Direform specializes in unyielding strength and
persistence, and this form is commonly used to guard
objects or prisoners. You have substantial carapace
with a jagged crest of spikes running along your head
and shoulders. You’re inclined toward obedience to your
superiors but obstinacy with others.
You’ve bonded with a callousspren, a type of Void-
spren. While in this form, your Strength increases by
2 and your deflect value increases by 2. This deflect
doesn’t stack with armor, so if you wear armor over
your carapace, choose which value to use.
Additionally, when a character triggers a Reactive
Strike from you, you can use that reaction to attempt
to Grapple them instead of attacking; when you do,
you must spend 1 focus as usual for Reactive Strike.
Stormform
Stormform is an elite battle form optimized for physical
prowess and honed attacks. You’re covered in finesse-
enhancing armored carapace that grows under your
skin, poking through in ridges and spikes. You can
manipulate and unleash powerful red lighting on
your foes.

IRINA NORDSOL

```
Forms of Expansion
Prerequisite: Ambitious Mind talent
Activation:
You gain two new forms of power—envoyform and
relayform—which you can transform into using your
Change Form.
Envoyform
Envoyform is an embellished form often used to serve the
administrative needs of the Fused. Your tall form towers
over others, and your ornate carapace is uniquely alluring.
You comprehend any language after brief exposure and can
grasp hidden context with the subtlest of cues.
You’ve bonded with a zealspren, a type of Voidspren.
While in this form, your Intellect increases by 1, your
Presence increases by 1, and you can speak, read, write,
and understand all languages.
Additionally, you gain an advantage on Insight tests
made to interpret the desires or intentions of others.
```

**relayform**

**decayform**

```
Relayform
Relayform boasts speed and stamina ideal for scouts.
Your agile and muscular body is protected in the front by
light carapace with smooth edges, and aerodynamic spikes
run along the backs of your forearms and calves. You can
run great distances and avoid detection.
You’ve bonded with a hastespren, a type of Voidspren.
While in this form, your Speed increases by 2 and you
ignore the effects of the Slowed condition.
Additionally, when you make an Agility, Stealth,
or Thievery test, you can spend 1 focus to gain an
advantage on that test.
```

**36** Chapter 2: Origins

```
IRINA NORDSOL
```

```
Nightform
Nightform grants unpredictable visions of the future,
and your senses become more acute, especially at night.
Petal-like carapace grows from your skull, framing your
ears and enhancing your ability to perceive rhythms.
In various lights, your carapace reflects different
iridescent patterns.
You’ve bonded with a nightspren, a type of Voidspren.
While in this form, your Awareness increases by 1 and
your Intellect increases by 1. When you change into
this form, your maximum focus and current focus both
increase by 2, and when you assume a different form,
both decrease by 2.
Additionally, your bond with a nightspren has
granted you precognitive abilities—whether you
wish them or not. While in this form, you gain the
Intervening Premonitions and Sporadic Premonitions
abilities:
Intervening Premonitions. At the start of each session,
roll two d20s and record both results. When an enemy
or willing ally you can sense makes a test, you can use this
reaction to replace the test’s d20 roll with one of your
recorded numbers. You can replace that number after you
see their die roll and after they apply any advantages, but
you must do so before the effects of the test are resolved.
You lose a recorded number when you use it to replace a
d20 roll or when the session ends, whichever comes first.
Sporadic Premonitions. At the GM’s discretion, you might
occasionally receive glimpses of the future at unpredictable
times during gameplay. When this happens, the GM might
describe vague flashes of imagery, sounds, and impressions
in your mind, hinting at what may come.
```

Forms of Mystery
**Prerequisite:** Ambitious Mind talent
**Activation:**
You gain two new forms of power—decayform and
nightform—which you can transform into using your
Change Form.
**Decayform**
_The enigmatic decayform grants an insidious ability
to sap the vitality of other beings. Your thin carapace
is jagged, brittle, and asymmetrical. People you touch
find themselves less resilient while you remain in contact
with them. This spiritual decay affects not just their
bodies, but their minds, leaving them with nightmares
long after the fact._
You’ve bonded with a blightspren, a type of Voidspren.
While in this form, your Willpower increases by 2
and you can use Decaying Touch:
**Decaying Touch.** Before a character within your
reach recovers health or focus, you can spend 1 focus or
1 Investiture to prevent them from doing so. The character
does not regain that health or focus, but any actions, Invest-
iture, or other resources they spent still remain spent.

```
Rules Tip: Actions and Reactions
Some forms of power grant unique actions, reactions, or
other abilities: stormform gives you the Unleash Lightning
action, nightform gives you the Intervening Premonitions
reaction, and some other forms allow you to spend focus
or Investiture on special effects without using an action.
In chapter 9 (“Adventuring”) and chapter 10 (“Combat”),
you’ll learn everything you need to know about using
abilities like these—but if you’re not sure where to start,
check out the “Terms from Later Chapters” sidebar in
chapter 4.
```

```
Voidspren and Forms of Power
While most spren who bond with singers are connected to
the Shards of Honor or Cultivation, Voidspren are powerful
spren connected with Odium. Bonding a Voidspren
makes you more susceptible to Odium’s influence—but
it also grants you access to powerful forms. The Forms of
Destruction, Forms of Expansion, and Forms of Mystery
talents each grant you access to two of these forms of
power (also known as Regal forms).
In these forms, you can hum to new, malevolent
rhythms, and you may find that ordinary rhythms feel
distant. Your newfound power emboldens you, and
depending on your personality, you might feel increased
aggression or apathy toward others. If you have a Nahel
bond with a Radiant spren, this helps you retain your usual
disposition without a struggle.

Rosharan Cultural Expertises
Each culture’s subsection begins with a brief description
of that culture; these aren’t comprehensive, but they
serve as a quick reference for the basic information

you can learn much more about Roshar’s nations and
cultures in chapter 2 of the Stormlight World Guide. )
These summaries are followed by examples of common
names from that culture. Each subsection concludes
with the cultural expertise you gain if you choose that
culture for your origins.
```

```
Alethi
Alethkar is ruled by a monarch and ten highprinces,
and the nation is driven by war and conquest. The
Vorin religion is practiced by proxy, with ardents acting
as religious servants of the noble class. Gender roles are
strictly enforced in Alethi society: women are expected
to engage in scholarly and domestic pursuits, and men
in warfare and physical labor. However, ardents have
more flexibility to exist outside of the harsh gender
binary imposed by Vorinism. The lightness of one’s eyes
determines their social caste, with the privileged dahn
system designated for lighteyes and persecuted nahn
for darkeyes. Singers and some darkeyed humans suffer
enslavement at the hands of the upper class.
Most Alethi people are tall and have tan skin and
dark hair. Men typically wear uniforms or work clothes.
Women either wear silk dresses called havahs that
cover their left hands for propriety, or less ornate work
clothes with gloves to conceal their left hands. Due to
Vorin custom, few men are literate, though most have
a rudimentary understanding of glyphs.
Alethi Names
Adelar, Arin, Dannic, Elhamir, Ersha, Hilar, Janar,
Kalith, Lanerin, Marith, Nar, Ravir, Rilin, Selith,
Taren, Tel, Valerin, Varda, Yaladir, Zalith.
Alethi Expertise
As a character with the Alethi expertise, you know
the names, locations, and highprinces of each prince-
dom. Choose a princedom your character has lived in.
You can replicate its regional dialect, and you know how
to find vendors, public organizations, and noteworthy
landmarks there. Choose how proficient you are in
spoken Alethi, and reading and writing glyphs, as well
as your literacy in women’s script (depending on your
gender and regard for gender norms). Regardless of your
religious beliefs, you’re familiar with the basic tenets of
Vorinism, the Almighty, and the Heralds.
```

## Culture

```
Your character’s culture isn’t determined by birth or
any other single moment in time. Instead, cultural
awareness can be shaped by nationality, ethnicity,
migration, traveling experience, and more. The
upcoming “Rosharan Cultural Expertises” section
presents cultural expertises for player characters;
in step 1 of character creation, you can choose two of
these expertises. And if you’re playing a singer, the
“Singers in Human Cultures” section helps you consider
your connections to the human-majority cultures of
the world. (To learn more about using expertises, see
“Expertises” in chapter 3.)
Your cultural expertises can be tied to your ancestry
and ethnicities if you’d like them to be; this is common
for characters who grew up in or spent significant time
in cultures tied to their lineage. Alternatively, you might
know little about any culture related to your lineage,
but be well-versed in the culture of a nation you were
raised in or studied abroad in. The cultures you choose
aren’t meant to limit your character’s identity; rather,
they highlight where your cultural awareness is most
comprehensive.
Either way, these expertises signify your character
knows information about that culture and its place
of origin, including potential fluency in an applicable
language. Your level of proficiency in spoken, signed,
and written language is up to you. Consider whether
you adhere to social customs around language or
not—for example, an Alethi man might have learned
to read despite cultural discouragement. There are
no right or wrong answers here.
```

```
Culture as a Canvas, Not the Painting
No group of people is a monolith. Rather than basing
your character’s personality on the cultural details in the
following sections, instead think of your culture as a series
of stimuli you’ve been exposed to. Do you flourish in this
cultural environment, or do you feel like an outsider? What
aspects of social customs resonate with you, and which
ones don’t? If you’re Herdazian, you might scoff at being
called “cousin” by a stranger who only shares your general
ancestry—or the term might bring you a profound sense
of comfort and belonging in a foreign land. The one or two

Herdazian
Herdaz is a verdant nation ruled by a monarch. Most
of its territory is taken up by its two hundred and three
hog ranches, for which Herdaz is famous. There are also
large diasporas of Herdazians in neighboring nations,
as nearly half of their population has left their ancestral
land seeking opportunities or refuge from a long
history of foreign occupation. It’s common for fellow
Herdazians in foreign lands to warmly greet each other
as cousins.
Vorinism is popular in Herdaz, but the nation has
fewer ardents, and people of any status and occupation
can practice it personally. Most Herdazian Vorins
care deeply about their individual connections to
the Almighty and the Heralds, and they place little
importance on what they consider outward posturing.
Singer ancestry in their ancient history has bestowed
nearly all Herdazians with crystalline fingernails that
can function like flint when struck with a steel tool
called a sparkflicker. They are also more resistant
to poisons native to Roshar. Most Herdazians have
medium brown skin tones and brown hair.

Azish
The Prime Aqasix and a class of elite government
scribes called viziers lead the bureaucratic nation of
Azir and influence the Azish Empire’s member states.
While independent thought is encouraged in friendly
and official debates, most Azish look down on those
who fail to uphold procedure. Following said procedure
is made difficult by Azish legislature’s expansiveness.
Most Azish people have very dark brown skin and
black hair. They tend to be slightly shorter than people
in Eastern Roshar. Large hats are a fixture of Azish
uniforms and civilian fashion. Wraps and robes are worn
by all genders, with vibrant colors and symbolic patterns
indicating a person’s status. Azish is the official language
and is spoken, signed, and written by most citizens. It is
typically spoken in pleasant, agreeable tones.

Kharbranthian
Kharbranth, the City of Bells, is an independent city-
state that largely practices Vorinism. The mountain
that borders the city largely absorbs the initial impact
of highstorms, making them milder than in neigh-
boring regions. Once a pirate town, Kharbranth
has become a center of academic and medical
achievement, supported by robust trade. Healthcare
is free to all, including lower castes and foreigners.
Prospective surgeons from all over Roshar compete
for expensive educations at the Great Concourse of
Kharbranth. Scholars of other subjects flock to the
Palanaeum, the largest library in Roshar. Innovations
like a plumbing system enhanced by heating fabrials
earn the city a reputation of luxury.
Ethnically similar to the Veden and Alethi, most
Kharbranthians have tan skin and dark hair. Although
human slavery is banned in Kharbranth, this basic right
doesn’t extend to singers.

Iriali
Iri is ruled by three monarchs. The Iriali descended long
ago from offworlders, and most follow the religion of the
One. They believe their mission in life is to obtain a vast
diversity of experiences so they can eventually merge
their consciousnesses together at the end of the Long
Trail and become one being of extensive knowledge
and understanding. Their destined journey is said to
consist of seven worlds, of which they consider Roshar
the fourth. It is unknown when they must leave for the
fifth, so they remain ever vigilant and prepared.
Ethnic Iriali have golden skin and golden hair,
which many foreigners consider auspicious. Orna-
mental body paint adds contrast to their metallic
features. Iriali fashion favors pastel colors and flowy
fabrics, and people of all genders and ages commonly
wear wraps. Many Iriali forgo shirts altogether or wear
just a simple bandeau. Due to their religious emphasis
on journeying, items like practical shoes are considered
indicators of personal preparedness and faith.

Natan
The Vorin city-state of New Natanan is located near
the Ocean of Origins. This meager landholding is a
remnant of a much larger empire that was destroyed
long ago. The ruins of its capital, once called Storm-
seat, were reclaimed by the listeners and called Narak.
Today, some Natans live as nomads that travel the
desolate lands previously contained in their empire.
Ethnic Natans have pale blue skin and white hair.
They mostly exist in isolation, either as nomads or
as citizens confined to New Natanan by vigorous
highstorms that make sea travel exceptionally perilous.
Their sense of loss over their empire, particularly
Stormseat and its Oathgate, persists.

Listener
The listeners are a group of singers who defied Odium
long ago and settled near the Shattered Plains. Through
oral tradition, they retained their sense of identity
during “the long sleep,” a time when they lost access
to nearly all of their forms.
When they learned King Gavilar of Alethkar
intended to bring back the listener “gods”—the beings
who could take away their agency—the listeners had
him assassinated in an effort to retain their autonomy
and freedom from Odium’s influence. The Alethi,
who called the listeners “Parshendi,” waged the War
of Reckoning as vengeance for the death of their king.
Narak became the listeners’ home, and they slowly
recovered more forms to fight the humans.
The Song of Listing includes upward of ninety-
one forms, but only five were recovered before the
Everstorm: dullform, mateform, nimbleform, warform,
and workform. Similar to other singers, the listeners
are humanoid and typically have red and white or
red and black marbled skin, along with red carapace,
red or black hair strands, and dark gray eyes.

Listener Expertise
The Listener expertise is generally only available to
singer characters. If you’re a human who has lived or
worked closely with the listener people, your GM can
give you permission to choose this expertise.
As a character with the Listener expertise, you’re
aware of dullform, mateform, nimbleform, warform
and workform (even if you’re human and can’t assume
them yourself ), and you’re familiar with the listener
council known as the Five. Depending on your interests,
you might know some of the songs of the listeners. You
know basic facts about Shattered Plains ecology. Choose
how proficient you are in the listener language and how
familiar you are with the rhythms (though any singer
instinctively knows all the rhythms). You know about

As a character with the Reshi expertise, you know about
the existence of Tai-na greatshells, spren deities, and
tales of islands going to war. You’re familiar with the
basic ecology of the Reshi Sea and the locations of major
stationary islands. Choose how proficient you are in

they are typically sourced from. Regardless of whether
you choose to engage with the tradition yourself, you’re
familiar with the Reshi inclination toward fierce but
quickly resolved social conflicts.
Shin
The isolated nation of Shinovar is governed by Stone
Shamans who believe that stone is sacred and that
it shouldn’t be broken or walked on by commoners.
A mountain range offers Shinovar significant protection
from highstorms, which are already lighter so far west.
Non-native crops and animals flourish here, even those
that wouldn’t survive anywhere else on Roshar.
Farmers are highly esteemed, while warriors are
seen as lowly and destructive. Those people who
commit especially grievous offenses are named
Truthless. They must take a symbolic Oathstone
and hand it over to a master who claims authority to
command them and pass ownership as they please.
Shin skin tones vary widely, including pale pink
tones that are rarely seen outside Shinovar. Unlike most
human ethnic groups on Roshar, their eyes don’t have
epicanthic folds. Clothing customs assign vibrant colors
to people who add to society (such as farmers), and
duller colors to people who detract from it.
Naming conventions include a given name followed
by “son,” “daughter,” or “child,” and the name of a
parent. If a child disgraces their parent, the child must
add a degree of separation by repeating the middle part
of their name and replacing the last with a grandparent’s
name instead of their parent’s.
```

Natan Expertise
As a character with the Natan expertise, you’ve heard
tales of the lands the Natan people lost and what
they were like during their full glory. You know what
highstorms are like at full potency, as well as defensive
measures you can take to protect yourself and your prop-
erty. Choose how proficient you are in Natan or another
Vorin language. Regardless of your religious beliefs,
you’re familiar with the basic tenets of Vorinism, as well
as with the common Natan reverence for the moons.
Reshi
The Reshi Isles are a series of misty islands and
inhabitable Tai-na greatshell carapaces, each ruled by
a monarch. The Tai-na islands roam the Reshi Sea,
occasionally colliding in brief conflicts. Reshi people
worship these greatshell islands as their gods. Tourism
is common on the stationary islands.
Most Reshi have brown skin, black hair, and round
faces. Unfamiliar with the horrors of devastating
wars, they tend to fight fiercely with words but resolve
disagreements quickly. The intonation of their language
is sharp and spoken in quick bursts, making it difficult
for foreigners to learn.

Unkalaki
The Horneater Peaks are each ruled by a patriarch
called a nuatoma. Atop these steep and inhospitably icy
mountains, warm crater lakes form cozy microclimates
where crops flourish in balmy humidity. Unkalaki
people refer to these lakes as oceans. Traditional family
structures dictate each son’s occupation according
to their birth order; the first two sons are assigned as
hunters or farmers, the third as a craftsman, and the
fourth as a warrior. Occupations for other genders tend
to be more individualized and diverse.
Ethnic Unkalaki get their nickname of Horneaters
from their abnormally strong teeth that can crush crem-
ling shells, a feature they receive through their ancient
singer ancestry. They tend to be tall with red hair, and
their skin ranges from pale to tan. A rare few Unkalaki
can see spren that most humans can’t, earning the title
of Sighted.
In the Unkalaki tradition, a person’s full name is
a poem. In less formal situations, they go by a single
word or phrase from their name.

There are four major ethnic groups within the
borders of Jah Keved: Bav, Siln, Veden, and Unkalaki,
with Veden as the majority. Vedens comprise the
majority; they share many physical traits with the Alethi,
though they most commonly have black or red hair.
Their language is close enough to Alethi to be mutually
intelligible. Fashion trends are also closely tied between
the two nations.
In Jah Keved, sons are given a first name that
indicates their birth order; the first four sons are named
Nan, Tet, Asha, and Van. Second names are chosen by
parents. Surnames are passed down from the parent of
the highest dahn or nahn social order.

to your backstory, also choose how proficient you are in
the Alethi, Bav, or Siln languages. Regardless of your
religious beliefs, you’re familiar with the basic tenets of
Vorinism and current events relevant to the church.
Wayfarer
Occupation, exile, or tourism may lead a person to live
a life of traveling from one place to the next. You could
be a traveling surgeon reluctant to return home to Jah
Keved, a mercenary from Steen, or an Iriali tidereader
sent to gain insights from the shores of faraway lands.
Whatever the reason, the lifestyle of a perpetual
traveler involves learning land and sea routes between
major cities, remaining aware of bandit and pirate
risks, and maintaining familiarity with mobile storm
shelters, map-reading, and modes of long-distance
transportation.
Wayfarer Expertise
As a character with the Wayfarer expertise, you know
how to read international map keys. You can find trust-
worthy currency exchange hubs in major cities, which
can be used to switch out dun spheres for infused ones.
From your travels, you’ve learned basic greetings and
a few cultural touchstones from various nations.

of your religious beliefs, you know of the gods of the
waters, mountains, and trees, along with the practice
of worshiping spren as gods. You also know of the
phenomenon of strange offworld visitors emerging

might include forced labor, permanent separation from
loved ones, mockery, assault, malnourishment, and
being treated and traded as property. This is by no
means an exhaustive list; while many aspects of harm
are universal for all enslaved singers, others are unique
and deeply personal.
You’ve been exposed to human culture as a mostly
silent observer. What keen insights has your character
made in the time since they awakened in the Everstorm?
What cultural values and traditions have they internal-
ized? Many of the singers in Azir sued their nation for
back pay once they awakened, seeking acknowledgment
through the legal system. Any human cultures your
singer character has lived in are well within their
understanding. Which parts of those cultures do they
align with, and which harmed them or otherwise don’t
align? How do they generally feel toward humans now?
What do they see as the best way forward?
Along with enslavement, consider how slaveform
has affected your character. For example, discovering
rhythms that were withheld from them in slaveform
might be a heartbreaking experience that deepens their
grief and sense of loss, even as they strive to reclaim
their lives.
Listeners
A small enclave of singers known as the listeners
lives in the Shattered Plains. They oppose the human
Alethi who fight them for gemhearts under the guise
of avenging the fallen Alethi king. These singers
aren’t confined to what they know as “slaveform,”
though the forms they can access are still limited
compared to those of their forebearers. The listeners
cling to precious clues about their heritage and lost
forms through the keeping of songs. Humans call
the listeners “Parshendi” to differentiate them from
“slaveform” singers (who they know as “parshmen”),
as most humans understand little about the singers
and their cultures.
What exposure to humans has your character had,
if any? How do they generally feel about humans?
```

```
Singer Characters in Campaigns
Players of singer characters can work with their GM
to determine how their character fits within the time
period of their campaign. The Listener expertise
requires singer ancestry or GM permission, as humans
were largely unaware of the listener city of Narak and
the culture of its people. All other cultural expertises
listed are available to humans and singers, based on
where they have lived or spent considerable time.
```

Other Cultures
Characters aren’t limited to the specific cultures defined
above. With your GM’s approval, you can choose other
cultural expertises, such as the following:

**Other Nations.** You might decide to play a character
who is from (or familiar with) a Rosharan culture
that’s not detailed above. Feel free to create your
own expertise for any culture your character would
reasonably be an expert on. You can find information
about many cultures in the _Stormlight World Guide_ or
another canon resource.
**Subcultures.** Some subcultures have values and
norms that transcend national or ethnic identity.
You can choose an expertise in a subculture within
society—for example, High Society, Military Life,
or Underworld.

Singers in Human Cultures

If you’re playing a singer character, decide whether
you’re a listener or have lived as a “parshman” in a
majority-human society. In the case of the latter, it’s
likely your character was enslaved and persecuted by
the humans around them. Consider how the following
elements have influenced your character.

Previously Enslaved Singers
Before the arrival of the Everstorm, most singers across
Roshar were trapped in what they know as slaveform. In
this form, a singer’s mind and spirit are suppressed; they
speak only in terse phrases, apathetically follow orders,
and withhold any type of self-expression. Humans in
some nations enslaved singers in slaveform as “parsh-
men,” exploiting their inability to assert themselves or
object to forced labor. These singers couldn’t process
or consent to what was done to them, but they later
awakened from this form to the nightmarish realization
of all they had been through.
After the arrival of the Everstorm, enslaved singers
regained full access to their minds and the so-called
slaveform was no more. Unfortunately, most humans
who had enslaved these people continued to reject them
as inferior beings. Some singers held onto hope that
their human countryfolk would be honorable and work
with them in good faith to figure out a way forward
together. However, many joined Odium, seeing no other
way to protect themselves from their human oppressors.

**Processing Enslavement**
What are some ways your character was harmed by
their enslavement? There’s no such thing as an enslaved
person who is treated fairly or well. Examples of harm

hat does your character excel at?
Are they charming and quick-witted, or

These qualities of your character—along with many
more—are represented by the statistics you record
on your character sheet. These statistics allow your
character to interact with the rules of this game, and
thus, with the world of Roshar.
```

```
About Your Statistics
This chapter details the statistics you’ll select during
character creation (see chapter 1) and how they affect
various aspects of the game. Your statistics include the
following:
Attributes. Your six attributes determine your innate
characteristics. During gameplay, you won’t need to
pay much attention to these building blocks, but they
influence many elements of your other statistics.
Defenses. When another character makes a test against
you, your defenses determine whether their test
succeeds. Likewise, your abilities target your foe’s
defenses—the higher their defense, the harder the test.
Deflect. Your deflect value represents your resilience to
damage. It allows you to reduce energy, impact, and
keen damage.
Expertises. Your skills reflect things you do , but your
expertises reflect things you know. This specialized
knowledge can benefit you in navigating cultures,
recalling information, crafting fabrials, and
much more.
```

```
Health, Focus, and Investiture. Your health protects
you from injury or death, while your focus and
Investiture power your talents and other abilities.
Skills. Your skills represent your learned and practiced
abilities, and they determine how likely your tests are
to succeed.
Other Statistics. Your attributes influence other aspects
of your character; for example, your Speed affects your
movement rate. Each attribute’s section describes what
it affects, and character creation guides you through
calculating these statistics.
```

```
Physical, Cognitive,
and Spiritual
Throughout the cosmere, reality is composed of three
facets: the Physical Realm, the Cognitive Realm,
and the Spiritual Realm. Many of your statistics are
categorized into one of these facets, as seen in the three
columns of your character sheet:
Physical. Your physical statistics include your Strength
and Speed attributes, all skills that use those attributes,
your Physical defense, your health, your movement
rate, and your lifting capacity. These appear on the
first column of your character sheet.
Cognitive. Your cognitive statistics include your Intellect
and Willpower attributes, all skills that use those
attributes, your Cognitive defense, your focus, and
your recovery die. These appear on the second column
of your character sheet.
Spiritual. Your spiritual statistics include your Aware-
ness and Presence attributes, all skills that use those
attributes, your Spiritual defense, your Investiture,
and your senses range. These appear on the third
column of your character sheet.
In addition to these categories keeping the character
sheet organized, a few game rules reference them;
for example, the key talent in the Scholar heroic path
grants you additional ranks in cognitive skills. The skills
affected by Strength or Speed are physical skills , the
skills affected by Intellect or Willpower are cognitive
skills , and the skills affected by Awareness or Presence
are spiritual skills.

Lifting and Moving Characters
At your GM’s discretion, you might be able to lift
and move an unwilling character who you Grapple or
similarly have Restrained. However, depending on the
character, their nearby allies, and the environment, you
might take damage, need to succeed on a test to move
them, or experience other effects.
Carrying Capacity
While many items in this book mention their weights,
you aren’t expected to track exactly how much you’re
carrying at all times. Just be reasonable—if you want to
bring an entire library of books on your adventures, your
GM will likely ask how you’re transporting that wealth
of knowledge! When it becomes important to track
how much you’re carrying, you can use the following
guidelines.
```

## Attributes.

```
Every character has six attributes
that determine their innate characteristics:
Strength, Speed, Intellect, Willpower, Aware ness,
and Presence.
Each attribute is a number, the higher the better.
These determine the physical, mental, and spiritual
limits of your character. On Roshar, most humans and
singers don’t have attributes above 2. However, player
characters are extraordinary (even at 1st level), and as
you gain levels, you can increase your attribute scores
as high as 5. This range can increase even further for
some singer forms, Invested characters, massive beasts,
and other powerful creatures.
Each skill is associated with an attribute (listed in
parentheses on your character sheet). As described in
the later “Skills” section, that attribute score influences
your skill modifier, and thus how likely you are to
succeed with that skill.
Attributes also determine other elements of your
character, from how much you can carry to how many
expertises you have. The following sections detail the
attributes and how they affect the game.
```

```
Strength
Strength is your physical power, toughness, and
athleticism. It represents the raw strength and force
you can exert, along with your constitution and physical
resilience.
Lifting and Carrying
Your Strength determines how much weight you can lift
and carry, as shown on the Lifting Capacity table.
```

```
Lifting and Carrying Capacity
Strength Lifting Capacity Carrying Capacity
0 100 lb. 50 lb.
1–2 200 lb. 100 lb.
3–4 500 lb. 250 lb.
5–6 1,000 lb. 500 lb.
7–8 5,000 lb. 2,500 lb.
9+ 10,000 lb. 5,000 lb.
```

```
Lifting Capacity
Lifting capacity represents the maximum weight you
can lift by yourself in one attempt. You can’t sustain
this much weight for long, but if needed, you can safely
lift it over your head.

If you need to determine your movement rate when
you’re not in combat, you can complete around three
actions every 10 seconds. Similarly, to determine how
far you can run in 10 seconds, multiply your movement
rate by 3.
```

```
Affected Statistics
Your Speed score affects several of your statistics.
When your Speed changes, update the following
sections of your character sheet:
```

◆ (^) Physical defense
◆ (^) Movement rate
◆ (^) Speed-based skill modifiers (Agility, Light Weaponry,
Stealth, Thievery, Abrasion surge)
Intellect
**Intellect** is your applied intelligence and wit. It rep-
resents your ability to store and recall knowledge and
to deduce facts.
Additional Expertises
During character creation, all characters can choose
two cultural expertises. If your Intellect score is 1 or
higher, you can choose additional expertises equal
to that score (see the “Expertises” section later in
this chapter).
If your Intellect increases as you gain levels, you can
choose a new expertise for each Intellect point you gain.
Other Effects
Your Intellect score affects several of your statistics.
When your Intellect changes, update the following
sections of your character sheet:
◆ (^) Number of expertises
◆ (^) Cognitive defense
◆ (^) Intellect-based skill modifiers (Crafting,
Deduction, Lore, Medicine, Division surge,
Transportation surge)
Your carrying capacity represents how much weight
you can comfortably carry while walking. While you
can temporarily exceed this weight (to a maximum of
your lifting capacity), it’ll slow you down and eventually
exhaust you.
If you move while exceeding your carrying capacity
(including everything you’re wearing and carrying),
you become Slowed.
Additionally, each time you exceed your carrying
capacity for a cumulative period of 60 minutes, you
become Exhausted [−1]. This cumulative time resets
to zero after a long rest.
Affected Statistics
Your Strength score affects several of your statistics.
When your Strength changes, update the following
sections of your character sheet:
◆ (^) Physical defense
◆ (^) Health
◆ (^) Lifting capacity
◆ (^) Unarmed attack damage die
◆ (^) Strength-based skill modifiers (Athletics,
Heavy Weaponry, Tension surge)
Speed
**Speed** is your quickness and dexterity. It represents
your finesse and overall alacrity.
Movement Rate
Your Speed determines how quickly you can move
in combat and other tense situations. When you use
the Move action (described in chapter 10), you can move
up to your **movement rate** , as shown on the Movement
Rate table. When other abilities allow you to move, they
specify what rate you can use to move.
By default, you move by walking or similarly
propelling across the surface of the ground; you can
learn more about movement types in the “Movement
and Positioning” section of chapter 10.
**Movement Rate
Speed Movement**
0 20 feet per action
1–2 25 feet per action
3–4 30 feet per action
5–6 40 feet per action
7–8 60 feet per action
9+ 80 feet per action

```
Affected Statistics
Your Willpower score affects several of your statistics.
When your Willpower changes, update the following
sections of your character sheet:
```

◆ (^) Cognitive defense
◆ (^) Focus
◆ (^) Recovery die
◆ (^) Willpower-based skill modifiers (Discipline,
Intimidation, Cohesion surge, Transformation surge)
Awareness
**Awareness** is your wisdom and connection to the world
around you. It represents your ability to sense your
surroundings and relate to others around you.
Senses
Your senses encompass not only sight and hearing,
but any other ways you might perceive the world.
The higher your Awareness, the farther you can sense
while darkness, noise, or other distractions obscure
your senses. Use the Senses Range table to determine
your senses range, then see the “Senses” section later
in this chapter for details on how to use this range.
**Senses Range
Awareness Senses Range**
0 5 ft.
1–2 10 ft.
3–4 20 ft.
5–6 50 ft.
7–8 100 ft.
9+ Unaffected by obscured senses
Affected Statistics
Your Awareness score affects several of your statistics.
When your Awareness changes, update the following
sections of your character sheet:
◆ (^) Spiritual defense
◆ (^) Investiture (unless you use Presence)
◆ (^) Senses range
◆ (^) Awareness-based skill modifiers (Insight, Perception,
Survival, Gravitation surge, Progression surge)
Willpower
**Willpower** is your determination and mental fortitude.
It represents your cognitive resilience, ability to enact
your will on others, and resistance to outside influences.
Recovery Die
You r **recovery die** determines how efficiently you
recover health and focus when you take a break (see
the “Resting” section of chapter 9). Your Willpower
determines the size of your recovery die, as shown
on the Recovery Die table.

KATIE PAYNE

```
When a character makes a test against you, they’re
usually testing against your defense from the same
category as their skill (unless otherwise specified by the
effect that’s prompting the skill test). Your correspond-
ing defense sets the DC for that test.
In general, your Physical defense protects you
against physical tests, your Cognitive defense protects
you against cognitive tests, and your Spiritual defense
protects you against spiritual tests. (To learn which cat-
egory each skill falls into, see the “Physical, Cognitive,
and Spiritual” section at the beginning of this chapter.)
Especially when making a test against another
character, be aware that defenses might not be the only
factors affecting your DC, as described in the “Skills”
section later in this chapter.
```

## Deflect

```
When an enemy succeeds on an attack test against you
or when you take damage from another source, this
generally reduces your health, as described later in this
chapter. However, armor (or other effects) can grant you
a deflect value that reduces impact, keen, and energy
damage by that amount. For example, if your deflect
value is 2 and you take 5 energy damage, you deflect
2 damage, then reduce your health by 3.
Your deflect value also offers some protection from
serious injuries, as described in “Injuries” in chapter 9.
```

## Expertises

```
Each character has unique areas of knowledge acquired
through their upbringing, training, interests, and other
life experience. When your character specializes in a
particular area, you gain an expertise on that topic.
This represents your unique knowledge and ability in a
particular niche, which can’t be matched by characters
who don’t have that expertise.
```

```
Using Expertises
As described in step 4 of character creation, your
character starts with two cultural expertises from chap-
ter 2, plus additional expertises equal to your Intellect
attribute score. You gain an additional expertise each
time your Intellect score increases by 1. You might also
gain expertises from other character creation choices,
talents, rewards, experiences in adventures, or training
during downtime (see “Training” in chapter 9).
Most sources of expertise either specify the exact
expertise you gain or tell you to choose from a specific
category (see “Expertise Categories”). If unspecified,
you gain an armor, cultural, utility, or weapon expertise
of your choice. (You can’t choose a specialist expertise
unless your GM makes an exception.)
```

Presence

**Presence** is your charisma and bearing. It represents
your ability to influence others, build rapport, and reach
the masses.

Establishing Connections
When your adventures bring you to cities and other
inhabited areas, you’ll often want to determine whether
your character knows someone in the area. Your
Presence score can help the GM decide whether you
previously spent enough time in that region to have
an existing connection to call on. The Establishing
Connections table provides guidance on how long it
takes you to establish these connections, but this varies
with the situation and is up to the GM’s discretion.

**Establishing Connections**

```
Presence Time to Establish Connections
0 1 year
1–2 50 days
3–4 5 days
5–6 1 day
7–8 1 hour
9+ Your reputation precedes you. You have connections
in places you haven’t even visited.
```

Affected Statistics
Your Presence score affects several of your statistics.
When your Presence changes, update the following
sections of your character sheet:

◆ (^) Spiritual defense
◆ (^) Investiture (unless you use Awareness)
◆ (^) Established connections
◆ (^) Presence-based skill modifiers (Deception, Leader-
ship, Persuasion, Adhesion surge, Illumination surge)

## Defenses

Your attributes combine to form your **defenses** , which
protect you from unwanted effects. You have three
defense values: **Physical defense** (affected by Strength
and Speed), **Cognitive defense** (affected by Intellect
and Willpower), and **Spiritual defense** (affected by
Awareness and Presence).

Defenses and Difficulty Class

Your Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual defense
values equal:

```
10 + both attributes in that category +
any bonuses or penalties
```

```
Chapter 3: Character Statistics 51
```

```
Expert Crafting
Some specialized items can’t be crafted without a
specific expertise (see “Crafting” in chapter 7).
Item Expert Traits
Most weapons and armor, along with a few other items,
have expert traits (see chapter 7). These traits grant
additional benefits to characters with the specified
expertise.
Known Languages
If you have a cultural expertise for a specific nation or
culture, you can communicate with those who share
its language or languages. It’s up to you how well you
know those languages—you might be fluent with no
discernible accent, or you might only know enough
words to conduct basic trade.
For other expertises, you might know special
jargon or codewords connected with that subject. For
example, the Underworld expertise could allow you to
communicate covertly with local thieves’ guilds, while
the Engineering expertise could help you talk circles
around a mere layperson.
Regardless of what languages you know, it’s assumed
that all PCs can communicate well enough with each
other to easily share information and create plans
together (unless the GM wishes to highlight a language
barrier between two PCs as a specific plot point).
```

```
Expertise Categories
All expertises fall into one of five categories; armor,
cultural, utility, and weapon expertises are available
to all characters, while specialist expertises must
be obtained in special ways. These categories are
primarily descriptive, and you can have more than
one expertise from the same category; however,
```

```
Choosing Expertises
Unlike attributes, defenses, and skills, there isn’t a finite
list of expertises. Each expertise names a general area
of knowledge, but it’s up to you how your character
gained an expertise and what knowledge it confers.
For example, one character with the Military Life
expertise could be a singer who served in Odium’s
forces, while another could be a human who absorbed
their knowledge of warfare from being raised in the
Alethi culture. Though these two characters share the
same expertise, their knowledge might be drastically
different.
When choosing an expertise, consider what cultures,
weapons, armor, and areas of study your character
has significant experience with; this can be from your
backstory or influenced by current adventures. The
“Expertise Categories” section provides examples of
common expertises, but with your GM’s permission,
you can create a new expertise instead.
The more specific an expertise, the greater its
narrative impact. For example, if your character has
the Religion expertise, you have general knowledge of
all Rosharan religions, but you might need to test Lore
to recall obscure details about Stone Shamanism. By
contrast, with your GM’s permission, you might choose
an expertise in Stone Shamanism; this expertise won’t
help you with tests about Vorinism, but you’ll know
much more about Stone Shamanism without needing
to test for it.
```

```
Expertise Benefits
An expertise doesn’t directly add any abilities to your
character sheet, but it can assist you during the game
in several ways.
Assumed Knowledge
It’s assumed you automatically know all basic facts
about your area of expertise. When another character
might need to test Lore, Deduction, or Insight to learn
anything about that topic, you don’t need a test to recall
basic information.
Advanced Thinking
Beyond your automatic knowledge of the basics, your
depth in a particular subject allows you to make tests
that would be impossible for other characters. For
example, if your party wants to figure out how the
enemy’s intricate new fabrial works, only characters with
the Fabrial Crafting expertise can make a Deduction
test to learn that information.
When you make other tests related to your exper-
tise, a success might grant you more information
than an inexperienced character would learn with
the same result.
```

```
Creative Uses of Expertises
People’s knowledge of the cosmere is infinitely varied and
complex, and areas of study constantly grow and change
as new discoveries are made. As a result, it’s impossible to
define all the knowledge and capabilities that an expertise
grants. Instead, your expertises merely guide you on which
subjects your character specializes in. It’s up to you and
your GM to decide what you know based on where and
when in the cosmere you find yourself.
If you believe one of your expertises should allow you to
make a test, to automatically know something, or to gain
a situational benefit, ask your GM! Expertises are tools
to help creatively tell your story—it’s okay to stretch and
come up with cool new uses for them.
```

**52** Chapter 3: Character Statistics

```
Weapon Expertises
Weapon expertises pertain to the maintenance and
wielding of a specific type of weapon. (Some rare types
of weapons, such as Shardblades, require specialist
expertises rather than weapon expertises.)
If you have a weapon expertise, you’re adept in
cleaning, maintaining, and even creating that kind of
weapon. You can use the expert traits of that weapon
(described in chapter 7), as you know how best to wield
it in combat.
Examples. You can choose an expertise in any
non-special weapon type listed in chapter 7—for
example, the Shortbow expertise. You can also choose
the Improvised Weapon expertise and the Unarmed
Attacks expertise, despite them being special weapons.
```

```
some talents and other abilities apply only to expertises
from certain categories.
The following sections give examples of common
expertises that qualify for each category, but you’re
not restricted to the specific examples in these lists.
Talk to your GM if you’d like to have an expertise in
a different area.
Armor Expertises
Armor expertises pertain to maintaining and wearing
a specific type of non-Invested armor. (Some rare
types of armor, such as Shardplate, require specialist
expertises rather than armor expertises.)
If you have an armor expertise, you’re well-versed
in cleaning, maintaining, and even creating that kind
of armor. You can use the expert traits of that armor
(described in chapter 7), as you know how best to wear
and use it in combat.
Examples. You can choose an armor expertise in
any non-special armor type listed in chapter 7—for
example, the Leather Armor expertise.
```

```
Cultural Expertises
Cultural expertises pertain to regional, social, and
linguistic knowledge for a nation, culture, subculture,
or other group of people.
If you have a cultural expertise, you’re deeply know-
ledgeable about that group’s traditions, customs, and
superstitions. You also know their history and current
politics. You can communicate with others from that
group through spoken language, signed language, other
forms of communication, or all of the above.
Examples. You can choose any cultural expertise
from the “Culture” section of chapter 2—for example,
a character from Herdaz probably has the Herdazian
expertise, while a noble character might have the High
Society expertise.
Utility Expertises
Utility expertises pertain to tools, trades, technical
knowledge, and similar areas of study.
If you have a utility expertise, you’re practiced in an
area of technical knowledge, such as creating a certain
type of equipment or specializing in a discipline like
military planning and strategy. You’re skilled in specific
techniques, specialized equipment, and technical jargon
related to your area of expertise.
Examples. You can choose a utility expertise in
topics such as Animal Care, Armor Crafting, Engineer-
ing, Equipment Crafting, History, Military Strategy,
Religion, Riding Horses, or Weapon Crafting.
```

```
Chapter 3: Character Statistics 53
```

GAL OR

```
Focus
You r focus is a cognitive resource representing your
mental resolve and ability to resist influence and distrac-
tion, as well as to execute complex or precise maneuvers.
You r maximum focus equals:
2 + Willpower + any bonuses or penalties
Focus can be spent to fuel talents and other abilities,
or to withstand manipulation (see “Focus in Conversa-
tions” in chapter 11).
When you have no focus left, your attention might
waver, you might stare intently while working through a
problem, or you might be overcome with frustration or
another emotion.
You can partially recover focus during a short rest,
and you recover all your focus after a long rest (see
“Resting” in chapter 9).
```

```
Investiture
Investiture is a spiritual resource representing your
ability to hold and channel Investiture—an energy that
suffuses the cosmere. On Roshar, this represents your
ability to breathe in and hold Stormlight.
New characters don’t have Investiture, but if you later
choose a Radiant path, you’ll gain an Investiture pool
that works much like your focus does. When you do,
your maximum Investiture equals:
2 + either your Awareness or Presence
(whichever is higher) + any bonuses or penalties
See “Investiture and Stormlight” in chapter 5 for rules
on using your Investiture.
```

## Senses

```
In any scene, your senses and what you’re aware of
are key. This can be straightforward in an open field
on a sunny day, but senses are more complicated when
darkness and fog get involved—or when Lightwoven
illusions obscure the truth of the world.
Your senses encapsulate not just your vision, but your
hearing, smell, touch, and even your intuition. Someone
with excellent hearing might navigate pitch darkness
by their practiced ear. This game doesn’t have separate
rules for sight versus other senses; instead, it’s up to you
and the GM to decide what primary sense you most
heavily rely on to navigate the world.
```

```
Senses Range
Under most conditions, it’s assumed all characters can
sense things from a reasonable distance, at the GM’s
discretion. However, when your primary sense is entirely
obscured , this limits how far away you can detect
```

```
Specialist Expertises
Specialist expertises pertain to restricted spheres
of knowledge, such as wielding Shardblades and
Shardplate.
If you have a specialist expertise, you have significant
knowledge about a subject that’s been lost to history or is
otherwise inaccessible to the average person. On Roshar,
this primarily includes Shards, fabrials, the lost history
of the singers, and the lost history of the Radiants.
Restrictions. You can’t choose specialist expertises
when gaining an expertise from your Intellect. These
can only be granted by a talent, reward, or permission
from your GM.
Examples. You might gain a specialist expertise in
topics such as Half-Shards, Grandbows, Shardblades,
Shardplate, Warhammers, Fabrial Crafting, Singer
History, or the Knights Radiant.
```

## Health, Focus, and Investiture

```
Many of your abilities are powered or affected by three
expendable pools of resources: health, focus, and
Investiture. These are primarily calculated using your
attributes, but they can also be affected by bonuses or
penalties from talents and other effects.
```

```
Health
You r health is a physical resource representing your
stamina and resistance to minor wounds. When you
create your character, your maximum health equals:
10 + Strength + any bonuses or penalties
When you level up, your maximum health increases
as indicated on the Character Advancement table in
chapter 1. If your Strength changes, refer to the same
table to recalculate your health.
When you lose health, you might breathe heavily,
stagger under the weight of a blow, notice blood on your
clothes from a minor wound, or cry out from exertion.
See “Damage, Injury, and Death” in chapter 9 for more
details on losing health.
If your health is reduced to 0, that represents suffer-
ing a severe blow that knocks you out of the fight. When
reduced to 0 health, you suffer an injury and become
Unconscious (see “Conditions” in chapter 9), and you
run the risk of incurring more serious injuries.
You can partially recover health during a short rest,
and you recover all your health after a long rest (see
“Resting” in chapter 9). Some talents and other effects
provide other ways to recover your health; for example,
a character with a rank in Medicine can tend to your
wounds in combat (see “Medicine” later in this chapter).
```

**54** Chapter 3: Character Statistics

```
If an ability doesn’t require senses, you’ll still gain
a disadvantage on many tests against a target you can’t
sense (see “Targeting and Range” in chapter 10).
Sensing Hidden Characters
and Objects
No matter how good your senses are, you can’t auto-
matically see through any kind of deception, nor can
you spot hidden characters or objects. If an illusion
designed to trick you is obscuring an object, or if an
object is purposefully hidden from your ability to sense
it (such as with the Stealth skill), you must succeed on
the usual skill tests to spot it.
```

```
Senses and Disabilities
If you usually rely on a sense and suddenly lose it, this
can disrupt your perception of the world; for example, if
you rely on sight but someone throws crem in your eyes,
you might temporarily gain the Disoriented condition.
However, if you’re accustomed to having limited access
to one or more senses (such as with some disabled
characters), you already rely on other senses to interact
with your surroundings.
If you create a disabled character who has adapted
to other senses, you can make Perception tests (and all
tests) the same as an abled character. However, if you’d
like your disability to affect not only your story, but also
the game’s rules, you can work with the GM to decide
when your limited senses might make some tests impos-
sible, impose a disadvantage on others, or even grant an
advantage (reflecting your practice with other senses).
```

## Skills

```
Your character starts the game with eighteen skills ,
each representing your general competency in various
pursuits. This section presents general rules for skills and
tests, followed by descriptions of each individual skill.
```

```
Using Skills
When your character attempts a task that has a chance
of failure—a daring attack, a rousing speech, a subtle
theft—the GM will probably ask you to make a skill
test , as described in the “Rolling a Skill Test” section
in this book’s introduction. The same also applies to
NPCs and the GM; whether an NPC is attempting to
attack you or scale an imposing cliff, the GM will make
a test to determine that attempt’s outcome. (If you’re
attempting something that has no downsides or that
you’d eventually succeed on with enough attempts,
the GM probably won’t require a test.)
```

```
things. Depending on your primary sense, it could be
obscured by the roaring cacophony of a highstorm, by
the pitch black during the “hateful hour” of night when
no moons are visible, and so on.
You r senses range determines how far away you can
easily sense when your primary sense is obscured. Your
Awareness score determines this range (see “Awareness”
earlier in this chapter).
Within this range, you don’t have any trouble
detecting things with the help of your other senses.
But outside of this range, you can’t detect objects and
characters, and must move closer or try to target them
without senses (if you’re aware of them).
```

```
Targeting Without Senses
If you can’t sense something, it’s hard to affect it
with many abilities. For example, to target “a char-
acter you can sense” while your senses are obscured,
the character must be within your senses range.
```

```
Chapter 3: Character Statistics 55
```

ARI IBARRA

```
Set DC
Some abilities call for a specific DC to succeed. For
example, when you use the Field Medicine talent to
treat a wounded ally, you make a DC 15 Medicine test,
as stated in that talent’s text.
Defenses
When you make a skill test targeting another charac-
ter—such as picking their pocket or trying to intimidate
them—the DC of that test is usually determined by one
of that character’s defenses (see the earlier “Defenses”
section). This is typically the defense in the same
category as the skill being used; for example, if you’re
threatening someone, you’ll usually test Intimidation
against their Cognitive defense. However, the GM or
certain rules may occasionally have you use different
defenses; for example, the Feinting Strike talent lets
you make an attack against a target’s Cognitive defense
instead of their Physical defense.
Adjusting DCs. The relevant defense’s value sets
the base DC for that skill test, but the GM might further
modify the DC based on other circumstances, using the
upcoming Difficulty Class Examples table as guidance for
how big of an adjustment is warranted. For example, if
a character is particularly friendly to you, the GM might
lower the DC for persuading them; perhaps they have a
Spiritual defense of 14, but the GM lowers that DC to
11 for you. Or if a character is on high alert, it might be
significantly harder to pick their pocket. Unlike granting
you advantages and disadvantages, the GM doesn’t
necessarily have to tell you when something is modifying
a character’s defense, so use caution!
GM Discretion
In many cases, the GM sets the DC based on their
judgment of the difficulty of the task and the normal
range of DCs. The Difficulty Class Examples table
provides some guidance, but the GM can choose any
number that feels like a good fit.
The task’s difficulty should be gauged by the
abilities of an average humanoid, not a player character.
For example, if leaping a particular chasm would be
nearly impossible for a random citizen of Urithiru,
the Athletics test to do so would be DC 30.
```

```
Difficulty Class Examples
Difficulty DC
Easy 10
Medium 15
Hard 20
Very Hard 25
Nearly Impossible 30
```

```
You usually don’t need any ranks in a skill to test it,
but your chance of success increases with your inherent
aptitude (represented by that skill’s corresponding
attribute) and your relevant training (represented by
your rank in that skill).
Everything you attempt during gameplay uses one
of your skills—but there’s often more than one way to
accomplish a task! In each situation, consider the narra-
tive and mechanical implications of using one skill over
another. Your character’s approach to a task may reflect
their personality, experiences, and goals. Don’t just pick
a test and roll it; you’re telling a collaborative story, so
describe how you go about your attempt! Depending
on your approach, the environment, and other circum-
stances, the GM will let you know which skill test you
should roll.
Skill Ranks and Modifiers
Each skill is associated with one of your attributes, as
stated in parentheses in that skill’s title (both in this
chapter and on your character sheet’s list of skills).
Additionally, you have anywhere from 0 to 5  ranks
in each skill, depending on your tier and your choices
during character creation and advancement. Narratively,
ranks indicate your education and lived experience.
You r skill modifier equals your score in that skill’s
associated attribute + your number of ranks in that skill.
You’ll add this modifier to each test you make with that
skill, and you’ll also use it for a few other calculations;
for example, when you hit with an attack, you add your
skill modifier to the damage dealt (see “Attacking” in
chapter 10).
```

```
Difficulty Class
When you make a test, you roll a d20, add the modifier
for the chosen skill, and apply any bonuses or penalties.
Then compare that result to the test’s difficulty class
(or DC)—this is the target number you’re trying
to reach. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, you
succeed ; this means you accomplish your task and the
GM narrates the results. If the total is less than the DC,
you fail ; this means you make little to no progress on
what you were attempting.
Depending on the situation, DC can be determined
by the ability itself, by the target’s defenses, by the GM,
or by both characters making an opposed test against
each other.
```

**56** Chapter 3: Character Statistics

```
Opposed Tests
Occasionally, two characters actively want to make tests
against each other (such as when wrestling), or similarly,
one character’s actions would reasonably set the DC for
a later attempt to subvert that action. Opposed tests can
also resolve conflicts there aren’t specific rules for.
When such a conflict happens, the GM might have
both characters make an opposed test using relevant
skills. The DC is determined not by a set number or by
GM discretion, but by the result of your opponent’s test.
For example, if a Windrunner uses the Adhesion surge to
Lash an object to the ceiling, then you try to pry it off the
ceiling, you might test Athletics against their Adhesion.
To meet the DC and succeed (or to prevent the other
person from succeeding), your test result must exceed
your opponent’s. Determine the outcome as follows:
If you roll higher than your opponent, you meet the DC
and accomplish your goal (even if that goal was simply
to resist your opponent). In the Adhesion example,
your successful Athletics test means you pry the object
from the ceiling.
```

```
If you roll lower than your opponent, this means they
rolled higher than you, thereby meeting their DC.
So they succeed on their test and you fail on yours.
In the Adhesion example, their successful Adhesion
test means you can’t pry it off the ceiling.
If you tie with your opponent, nobody meets their DC!
In this case, both of you might fail to achieve your
contested objective—or, in the case of an aggressive
contest, the result favors the defender who’s trying to
keep things the same. In the Adhesion example, the
object was already stuck to the ceiling—so if neither of
you succeed on your opposed test, the object remains
stuck on the ceiling.
Automatic Successes
Some effects grant you an automatic success on a test.
When you automatically succeed, you don’t roll, and you
gain the benefits of a success with no Opportunities or
Complications. (Rarely, you might automatically fail a
test; handle this the same way, without rolling.)

Enemy NPC Tests
If an enemy NPC is making a test with advantages or
disadvantages, the roles of the GM and players are
reversed. For advantages, the GM gets to pick which
die to keep, and for disadvantages, a player gets to pick
(typically the player whose character is most affected by
the roll, to avoid slowing down play with group debate).
```

```
Varied Test Results
On a basic level, your DC and test result determine
whether you succeed or fail. However, most situations
are narratively much more complicated (and interesting)
than that. To help you, your fellow players, and the GM
tell the story together, this game provides additional
tools to narrate more interesting outcomes.
Degree of Success and Failure
While the DC sets a specific success/failure threshold,
test results can run a wide range of values from 1 to 30
(or even higher!). The difference between the test result
and DC can inspire more detailed descriptions about
how well the attempt succeeded or how horribly it failed.
In cases where the test result is very close to the
DC, you have a low degree of success or failure. You
(or the GM) might describe your character just barely
succeeding or getting incredibly close but failing at
the last second.
On the other hand, if your test result is far above
or below the DC, you have a high degree of success
or failure. You (or the GM) might describe your
character catastrophically failing at a task or expertly
overcoming it.
Opportunities and Complications
On tests where the GM has raised the stakes, the plot
die introduces a wide spectrum of outcomes due to
Opportunities and Complications. You can also gain
Opportunities and Complications from various talents
and from high or low d20 rolls (see “Opportunities and
Complications” in this book’s introduction). These
narrative side effects create an interesting mix of results.
When rolling the plot die, you’ll commonly get a
mix of good and bad: either succeeding with a Comp-
lication or failing with an Opportunity. These results
compellingly progress your story while introducing
twists or new ways forward. The Skill Examples table
at the end of this chapter provides inspiration for how
Opport unities and Complications might impact a test.
Occasionally, you’ll roll a success with an Opport unity
or a failure with a Complication (usually when you roll a
natural 1 or 20). These are the highest highs and lowest
lows, when you either gain exhilarating momentum
or stop dead in your tracks. Such moments can be
```

```
Advantages and Disadvantages
Sometimes, tests are modified by positive or negative
circumstances. In these cases, you’ll be instructed to
test with one or more advantages or disadvantages.
These could be from a rule of the game, or from the
GM granting it to you based on circumstances in the
narrative. For example, if you’re trying to research an
obscure myth in an archive, and you’ve read up on
regional folklore recently, the GM might give you an
advantage on that test. Meanwhile, if you’re trying to
scale a steep cliff, but the stones are slick with rain,
the GM might give you a disadvantage.
Testing With Advantages
For each advantage affecting the test, choose one die
you’re about to roll for your test; you can pick the d20,
the plot die, or any other die (like one of the damage
dice from an attack). Roll two of each chosen die, then
choose one of the two results to keep, discarding the
other with no effect.
You can choose each die only once during a
test. If you have two advantages, you’ll have to roll
copies of two different dice, instead of rolling three
of the same die.
Testing With Disadvantages
Conversely, for each disadvantage affecting the test, the
GM chooses one die you’re about to roll for your test.
Roll two of the GM’s chosen die, then allow the GM to
choose one of the two results you keep, discarding the
other with no effect. As with advantages, the same die
can’t be chosen twice.
Testing With Both
If a test is affected by both advantages and disadv-
antages, they cancel each other out; each disadvantage
cancels one advantage and vice versa. For instance,
if your test has two advantages and one disadvantage,
the disadvantage cancels one advantage, leaving you
with one advantage on the test.
Affecting Multiple Targets
Some abilities instruct you to make a single test against
multiple targets. However, you might have advantages
or disadvantages against only some of those targets.
In that case, first roll the test without those extra dice,
then roll the dice for your advantages or disadvantages
separately, applying them only to the results for the
affected targets and ignoring them for the other targets.
(For more information, see “Attacks with Multiple
Targets” in chapter 10.)

**58** Chapter 3: Character Statistics

a good time to pivot the action to other characters, using
your momentum to help others or giving someone else a
chance to step in after your failure.

**Trying Again**
When you fail a skill test, you might be able to
try again—if time and the situation allow. Failure
sometimes just costs precious time, and the clock keeps
ticking with each reattempt. But in other situations,
failure carries more consequences, and trying again can
require bigger and bigger risks.
Ultimately, it’s up to your GM how many times you
can retry a test before misfortune catches up with you.
When you try again, potential risks might simply be
narrative, or the GM might include mechanical effects
like the following:

◆ (^) Losing focus due to strain or unforeseen outcomes.
◆ (^) Losing health due to danger posed by the test.
◆ (^) Raising the stakes and risking a Complication,
such as getting caught or breaking the device
you’re working on.
**Resisting Influence**
When you succeed on a test to influence someone
socially, such as lying to them or convincing them to
help you, they might resist your influence by spending
some focus. When they do, you fail to influence them
despite your successful test. For details, see the “Focus
in Conversations” section of chapter 11.
**Ongoing Skill Effects**
Sometimes you might make a skill test for a single
action that you hope will have an ongoing benefit—
for example, a Thievery test to disguise yourself all day.
At the GM’s discretion, you might be able to apply such
a result across an extended time, but if the situation
changes significantly, you may need to make a new test.
To apply the same skill test to multiple characters
(such as tricking multiple guards with your existing
disguise as you wander through a building), keep track
of your original result. As you encounter other char-
acters, compare your result to the relevant defense of
each character (or to the result of their opposed test).
Skills as Actions
Skill tests don’t inherently require actions or reactions
to use. For example, the GM might ask everyone to
make a Discipline test (no action required) to steel their
nerves against a fearsome foe. However, if you make a
test to do something that takes time or concentration,
the GM will usually ask you to use to do so (via the
Use a Skill action in chapter 10).
If you’re making a test as part of another action, you
don’t need to use.
Working Together
When you attempt a task with the help of others,
you typically don’t all make separate tests. Instead,
use the following rules to work together on a test.
**Helping in Combat**
Assisting allies in combat can be challenging, as every
second matters. If you want to help in combat, you must
use the Aid reaction (see “Actions and Reactions” in
chapter 10).
**Helping Outside Combat**
Outside of combat, whoever is leading the group effort
makes one test, and they gain an advantage for each
character helping them. You can often choose this leader
based on who has the best skill modifier, though in some
situations, you might not have a choice.
The GM may ask you to describe exactly how
you’re contributing to a test. Characters can only
help with tests they could reasonably complete them-
selves. For example, a character can’t assist with a
task that requires an expertise or tools they don’t have.
Additionally, if the task requires physical contributions,
each character helping must be able to reach and
contribute to the task.
**Helping in Complex Situations**
For complex or particularly important tasks involving
a group, the GM might have your group complete an
endeavor (see chapter 12), rather than a single test
with advantages. For example, if you’re sneaking into
a guarded encampment, the GM will probably ask for
more than a single Stealth test.
Changing Die Size
Some abilities let you change a die’s **size** ; this doesn’t
refer to its physical measurements, but to how many
sides it has.
When you make a test with a die whose size is
increased, replace it with the next largest die (and vice
versa when decreasing). For example, an attack that
originally deals 1d4 damage might increase its die size
as you gain levels; allowing you to roll 1d6 in its place
(and eventually 1d8, 1d10, and 1d12).
Targeting From a Distance
Some tests target other characters (or objects) from
a distance. The “Targeting and Range” section of
chapter 10 defines which characters are eligible targets
for various tests. Note that if you can’t sense a character,
you usually gain a disadvantage on tests made to directly
affect them (such as with surges and weapon attacks).

```
Anatomy of a Skill
The upcoming sections describe the eighteen basic skills
available to all characters in this game. (In addition to
these skills, you might later choose a Radiant path and
unlock unique surge skills, as described in chapter 5.)
Each section includes the following details:
Title and Attribute. Each entry’s title states the name
of that skill, followed by the associated attribute. You’ll
use this attribute to calculate your skill modifier, as
described earlier in “Skill Ranks and Modifiers.”
Relevant Tasks. Each entry lists some tasks that use that
skill. This isn’t a comprehensive list—it’s up to you and
your GM to decide what skill best applies for anything
you might attempt.
Special Situations. Some entries provide guidance
for using that skill in special ways. For example, the
Medicine skill gives examples of how you can treat
wounded allies.
Gaining Advantage. Each entry suggests creative ways
you might use that skill with the Gain Advantage
action (see “Actions and Reactions” in chapter 10),
giving you the upper hand on your next test
against that foe.
Examples. Finally, at the end of the chapter, the Skill
Examples table includes several examples of tasks,
suggested DCs, and inspiration for how you and the
GM might resolve successes, failures, Opportunities,
and Complications. Many of the outcomes in these
tables are purely narrative; however, some include
mech anical effects that can heighten the drama or
give players a chance to use their abilities. GMs are
encouraged to improvise such effects regardless of
whether the game rules directly call for them, and
players should feel free to suggest interesting effects
that support the story.
```

```
Agility (Speed)
Agility reflects your capacity to maneuver within your
environment, steer a mount, execute acrobatic feats,
and pilot vehicles with precision. When your reflexes,
mobility, or maneuverability are challenged by a task,
you test Agility.
Gaining Advantage. You might Gain Advantage
with Agility by...
```

◆ (^) Nimbly rolling to attack at an unexpected angle.
◆ (^) Bobbing and weaving quickly to throw your opponent
off-balance.
◆ (^) Slipping inside an opponent’s guard, making it harder
for them to defend against attacks.
Athletics (Strength)
Athletics reflects your physical prowess, brawn,
endurance, and resistance to harm and physical
adversity. Athletics can allow you to overcome an
obstacle with feats of strength such as lifting, pushing,
climbing, jumping horizontally and vertically, and
pulling. Athletics is also used to make unarmed attacks,
as described in the “Weapons” section of chapter 7.
**Jumping.** While moving, a character can generally
jump a horizontal distance equal to their own size
without making a test, and a vertical distance equal to
half their size (see “Movement and Positioning” in chap-
ter 10). For longer jumps, they must make an Athletics
test. This test’s DC is determined by the GM, but as a
general guideline, a 40-foot jump on Roshar would be
nearly impossible (DC 30) for a Medium character.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Athletics by...
◆ (^) Leaping onto a foe to throw them off guard.
◆ (^) Seizing an enemy’s shield to get an opening to attack.
◆ (^) Flexing menacingly to shake an opponent’s resolve.

Crafting (Intellect)
Crafting uses your ingenuity and knowledge to design
and build physical objects with what you have on hand.
When you’re crafting commonplace items like simple
machines, traps, pottery, woodworking, sketches, sew-
ing, or impromptu tools, you test Crafting to determine
your success.
Crafting Complex Items. If you want to create
more complex items like weapons, armor, equipment,
buildings, grand works of art, and fabrials, you need to
have a corresponding expertise to make a Crafting test.
The “Crafting” section in chapter 7 presents the full
rules of crafting.
Repairing Items. This game has no specific rules
about damaging or repairing existing items, and it’s
assumed you can competently maintain your equipment.
But when it suits the story, the GM might call for a
Crafting test to repair or reassemble an important item.
Gaining Advantage. You might Gain Advantage
with Crafting by...
```

◆ (^) Scooping dust or dirt into a pouch to use as a
makeshift powderbomb.
◆ (^) Attaching rope or cloth to a weapon, making its
trajectory harder to track.
◆ (^) Deploying an improvised device to flash light
into someone’s eyes.
Deception (Presence)
Deception measures how well you can mislead others
with blatant dishonesty, clever insinuations, exagger-
ations, and strategic omissions. Using this skill can
include carefully chosen words, but also emotional
manipulation, deflection, falsified evidence, and
misleading body language.
**Long-Distance Deception.** When trying to deceive
others from afar—such as via spanreed communication,
letters, or messenger—uncontrollable variables make
Deception more difficult. A long-distance recipient is
less likely to be fooled by a convincing performance,
and more likely to employ unseen aid and evidence.
As a result, you make Deception tests with a disad-
vantage if your target can’t sense you.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Deception by...
◆ (^) Pretending to aim or swing from a certain direction,
only to change at the last moment.
◆ (^) Wearing the enemy’s uniform on a hectic battlefield.
◆ (^) Lying to your foe and rattling their composure.
Deduction (Intellect)
To understand the world, one must observe, question,
and test. Through logic, reason, accruing evidence,
and interpreting it, you can test Deduction to more
confidently navigate the many uncertainties that
surround you.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Deduction by...
◆ (^) Inferring a foe’s weakness or hidden injury
by observing their behavior.
◆ (^) Reflecting on a character’s rhetoric to discern their
true motives.
◆ (^) Identifying a foe’s most useful asset and how
to impede it.
Discipline (Willpower)
Discipline determines your ability to control your
outward reactions and responses to unsettling circum-
stances. Discipline can help you maintain composure
in the face of fear, anger, pain, or sorrow. This doesn’t
mean you don’t feel these emotions, but you can think
and act with exceptional clarity and poise even under
great duress.
**Overcoming the Odds.** Discipline can be used
actively, such as when putting on a brave face while
approaching a formidable foe. However, it can also be
used reactively to shake off fear, doubt, distraction, and
similar challenges. The GM might sometimes have
you test Discipline to avoid an unwanted effect or to
later overcome it.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Discipline by...
◆ (^) Waiting until the perfect moment to strike.
◆ (^) Unnerving the foe by holding firm despite
their advance.
◆ (^) Marching into obvious danger without showing fear.
_During the final weeks as bridgemen,
they’d learned to act with the precision
and discipline of soldiers. They stood at
attention while their abusers marched
across bridges, never uttering a word
of derision. Their discipline itself had
become their weapon._

Heavy Weaponry
(Strength)
Heavy Weaponry represents your exper ience
wielding the most devastating weapons of
warfare. You test Heavy Weaponry when you
attack with or otherwise use weapons that are
literally heavy, such as axes and hammers, along
with most Shardblades.
Heavy vs. Light Weaponr y. Weapons t hat
use the Heavy Weaponry skill tend to have greater
reach and heft than light weapons, increasing
their lethality but reducing their maneuverability
and precision. The “Creative Maneuvers” section of
chapter 10 suggests creative ways you might fight with
your heavy weapon.
Gaining Advantage. You might Gain Advantage
with Heavy Weaponry by...
```

◆ (^) Distracting foes by winding up a danger-
ous-looking swing.
◆ (^) Dramatically drawing a sheathed heavy weapon.
◆ (^) Performing a practiced kata with your weapon,
demonstrating your skill.
Insight (Awareness)
Insight measures your ability to discern the true feelings
of others, see through deceptions, and use your intuition
to determine whether a situation is off. When your social
instincts, emotional intelligence, and gut reactions are
challenged by a task, you test Insight.
**Advantages.** You might Gain Advantage with
I nsig ht by...
◆ (^) Manipulating the right emotions to provoke
a sloppy—and revealing—response.
◆ (^) Following a hunch that a rival is posturing to appear
more powerful than they are.
◆ (^) Appealing to a foe’s underlying desire that conflicts
with their current actions.
Intimidation (Willpower)
Intimidation reflects your ability to induce fear in
another character and thereby ensure their compliance.
When you project physical dominance, issue a threat
(whether explicit or implied), or intentionally catas-
trophize a situation, you test Intimidation.
**Insincere Threats.** Most threats include some
degree of exaggeration, such as overstating your willing-
ness or ability to make good on the threat. If a threat is
plausible to the receiving party, bluffing doesn’t affect
how the test is made. However, if you’re feigning some-
thing preposterous, such as claiming to be a fearsome
warrior while you’re visibly ill and can’t stand up,
you gain a disadvantage on your Intimidation test.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Intimidation by...
◆ (^) Singing, humming, or speaking to contentious
rhythms (if you’re a singer).
◆ (^) Mocking your enemy.
◆ (^) Displaying signs of “the Thrill.”
Leadership (Presence)
Leadership represents your ability to inspire people,
draw attention, and command allies. When you appeal
to someone’s better nature or sense of right and wrong,
An Azish Commandant
leads her troops into battle.
**62** Chapter 3: Character Statistics
JOEL CHAIM HOLTZMAN

you test Leadership. You can also use this skill to
delegate tasks, manage a crowd, bait an enemy, or
direct allies who aren’t strictly under your command.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Leadership by...

◆ (^) Challenging an enemy to a one-on-one duel.
◆ (^) Calling nearby allies to cover your advance toward
t he enemy.
◆ (^) Asking a nearby companion to help.
Light Weaponry (Speed)
Light Weaponry represents your facility with
smaller armaments that are wielded with finesse
rather than raw strength. When you attack with or
otherwise use knives, short swords, bows, slings,
and similar weapons, you test Light Weaponry.
**Light vs. Heavy Weaponr y.** Though light weap-
ons don’t have the same range and damage as heavy
weapons, they’re more quick, subtle, and precise. The
“Creative Maneuvers” section of chapter 10 suggests
creative ways you might fight with your light weapon.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Light Weaponry by...
◆ (^) Feinting with an intricate flourish, drawing a foe’s
attention away from the real threat.
◆ (^) Conspicuously patting a concealed weapon, calling
attention to its presence.
◆ (^) Throwing a weapon as a distraction from some
other action.
Lore (Intellect)
Lore establishes your familiarity with history,
current events, folklore, religions, places, and science.
When you attempt to recall information that you could
reasonably know from your background, you test Lore.
**Lore and Expertise.** In addition to the general
Lore skill, your expertises represent areas of specific
knowledge (see the earlier “Expertises” section). If you
want to recall basic information relating to an
exper-tise of yours, the GM should generally give you
the information without a test. By contrast, if you
want to know secret, forbidden, or otherwise obscure
knowledge about a subject, you might have to test even
if you have an expertise. If you succeed on a test to recall
such hidden knowledge but you don’t have the relevant
expertise, you might not learn enough key details to
gain the full picture.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Lore by...
◆ (^) Demonstrating how your target’s actions don’t
line up with the beliefs they claim to uphold.
◆ (^) Recalling your target’s inherent weaknesses
or reservations.
◆ (^) Recognizing the useful properties of something
in the environment.
Medicine (Intellect)
Medicine measures your ability to heal yourself and
others through your knowledge of anatomy, psychology,
and surgery. When you attempt to diagnose physical
maladies, support those with mental or physical
illnesses, or determine a corpse’s time and cause of
death, you test Medicine. You might even carry surgical
supplies (see “Items” in chapter 7) to make your
ministrations more effective.
**Using Medicine in Combat.** If you have at least
one rank in Medicine, you can spend 2 focus and Use
a Skill (see “Actions and Reactions” in chapter 10) to
make a DC 15 Medicine test to treat a conscious ally
within your reach, or you can make the same test with a
disadvantage to treat yourself. On a success, your target
recovers health equal to your ranks in Medicine.
**Using Medicine While Resting.** During a long
rest, you can make a DC 20 Medicine test to treat
an ally’s injury (see “Injuries” in chapter 9), or you
can make the same test with a disadvantage to treat
yourself. On a success, the duration of a shallow or
vicious injury is reduced by 1d4 days. Once a character
has been treated in this way (whether successfully or
unsuccessfully), they can’t be treated in this way again
during that long rest.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Medicine by...
◆ (^) Spotting a previous injury you can exploit in
your opponent.
◆ (^) Thinking of a specific medicine to use in
this moment.
◆ (^) Alleviating an injured ally’s pain so they can
support your next maneuver.
**Leadership or Persuasion?**
When you test Persuasion, you’re typically convincing
someone to help you by negotiating, appealing to logic or
self-interest, and pointing out the practical implications
of a decision. When you test Leadership, you’re usually
seeking to inspire, appealing to higher ideals, and char-
ismatically taking control of a situation. Some problems
can be solved with either skill, though the DC for each test
may vary significantly depending on your target and your
own intentions.
Chapter 3: Character Statistics **63**

```
Perception (Awareness)
Perception signifies your ability to notice details about
your surroundings. When you inspect the area around
you, search for a hidden character or item, or try to rec-
ognize something from your memory or a description,
you test Perception. (The upcoming “Stealth” section
contains rules for detecting hidden characters.)
Senses and Perception. Much like this game
doesn’t restrict your senses to sight and hearing, you
don’t need access to all senses to test Perception. The
earlier “Senses” section provides guidance on navigating
the world with limited senses, but in general, each
character tests Perception in the same way regardless
of which senses they can access.
Gaining Advantage. You might Gain Advantage
with Perception by...
```

◆ (^) Spotting something in your environment to use to
your advantage.
◆ (^) Using depth perception to gauge the exact distance
between you and a target.
◆ (^) Observing a weakness in an enemy’s stance.
Persuasion (Presence)
Persuasion reflects your charisma, social fluency, and
assumed trustworthiness. When you barter, debate,
reason, or appeal to self-interest, you test Persuasion.
While Deception and Intimidation tests might allow you
to pressure an unwilling target into compliance, you’ll
usually test Persuasion if you’re seeking agreement and
a reasonably amicable outcome.
**Feelings as Information**
Perception helps you collect facts about your sur-
roundings. By contrast, Insight helps you interpret your
subconscious impressions of other characters’ words,
body language, and similar cues. Of course, your biases
can lead you astray, making your feelings less trustworthy.
Existing biases might cause you to gain a disadvantage
on an Insight test—or if you fail an Insight test or gain
a Complication on one, you might obtain misleading
information.
**Attitudes.** People are more likely to agree with
you if they already find you pleasant, intelligent, and
trustworthy. If you have a good rapport with someone
(or a particularly strained relationship), the GM may
choose to decrease (or increase) the DC to reflect the
target’s attitude toward you.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Persuasion by...
◆ (^) Negotiating the terms of a duel.
◆ (^) Distracting a foe with clever banter.
◆ (^) Making a genuine offer of peace.
Stealth (Speed)
Stealth represents your ability to avoid or escape
attention. When you attempt to sneak, hide, blend into
a crowd, or similarly avoid notice or lose pursuers, you
test Stealth.
**Hiding in Combat.** In combat, you can Use a Skill
(see “Actions and Reactions” in chapter 10) to attempt
to hide from a character, making a Stealth test against
their Spiritual defense. You can hide only if you’re in
cover, if you’re in an area where your target’s primary
sense is obscured (such as darkness), or if your target
has no line of effect to you (see “Targeting and Range”
in chapter 10). If you’re attempting to hide from more
than one character, compare your test result to each
character’s Spiritual defense.
Each character who you succeed against loses track
of you and can no longer sense you, and they remain
unaware of your exact location until you attack or
take another action that would logically expose your
position. As , you can covertly signal one or more
allies you can sense, revealing your position to them.
A character searching for you can Use a Skill to make
a Perception test to search for you; the DC for this test
equals the result of your original Stealth test, and it
gains a disadvantage if you’re in cover or an area where
the character’s primary sense is obscured. On a success,
that character senses you.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might Gain Advantage
with Stealth by...
◆ (^) Briefly ducking out of view to disguise what
you’re doing.
◆ (^) Using an object you had hidden up your sleeve.
◆ (^) Feinting one direction before moving in another.

```
Survival (Awareness)
Survival indicates your competence in obtaining vital
resources and shelter, avoiding environmental threats,
and understanding animal behavior. When you track
someone or something, interact with wildlife, or
navigate unfamiliar territory, you test Survival.
Foraging in Nature. During a short rest, you can
try to collect resources like food, water, or medicinal
plants. When you do, you forgo the other benefits of
resting and instead test Survival. On a success, you
identify useful natural resources and safely collect some.
For example, you might painstakingly milk knobweeds
in the Shattered Plains during your short rest, producing
one dose of potent antiseptic (see “Equipment” in
chapter 7). The DC for foraging depends on where
you’re foraging and what (if anything) you’re specifically
looking for. The GM might deny this option if an area
has nothing noteworthy to hunt or gather, or if foraging
would be too risky.
Gaining Advantage. You might Gain Advantage
with Survival by...
```

◆ (^) Working with an animal companion to coordi-
nate attacks.
◆ (^) Using knowledge of the terrain to find a favorable
position to act.
◆ (^) Adjusting a ranged attack based on weather
conditions.
Thievery (Speed)
Thievery covers all manner of tasks that require precise
manual dexterity or are useful in skulduggery. When
you pickpocket, lockpick, perform sleight of hand,
escape from bonds, tie knots, or create disguises, you
test Thievery.
**Pickpocketing in Combat.** You can Use a Skill
(see “Actions and Reactions” in chapter 10) to make a
Thievery test to pick the pocket of a character within
your reach. When you make this test, raise the stakes.
The DC of this test equals the target’s Spiritual defense,
and you gain a disadvantage if the target is aware of
your presence.
**Gaining Advantage.** You might use Gain Advan-
tage with Thievery by...
◆ (^) Using sleight of hand to make something you’re
holding seemingly disappear into thin air.
◆ (^) Subtly drawing a weapon to catch your foe unawares.
◆ (^) Donning a ridiculous piece of pre-prepared
costuming to shock your target.

**Heroic Paths**

**CC**

```
haracters in Stormlight campaigns are
heroes: they help others in need, save innocent
lives, and fight against the rising tide of Odium’s
power. The six heroic paths presented in this chapter
represent the mundane competencies each hero uses
to make their mark on the world. Whether you’re a
skillful Agent, an erudite Scholar, or an indomitable
Warrior, your path and its talents represent the unique
comb ination of tricks and techniques you use to navigate
life on Roshar.
```

## Using Paths and Talents Chapter 4: Heroic Paths

```
As a player character, the abilities on your character
sheet primarily come from your talents (see “Using
Talents” later in this section). You’ll gain your first
talent during character creation, then choose more
as you gain levels.
You r path provides structure for how you choose
your talents. It begins with a key talent that, once
chosen, unlocks access to the talents within that path’s
three specialties. For example, once you pick the
Vigilant Stance (Warrior Key) talent, you gain access to
the Duelist, Shardbearer, and Soldier specialties within
the Warrior path.
```

```
Heroic and Radiant Paths
Over the course of their adventuring career, player
characters can—and most do—choose talents from
multiple paths and specialties. This can include addi-
tional heroic paths or a Radiant path. You might also
be able to choose unique talents from other sources,
such as the Singer talent tree in chapter 2.
All player characters begin by choosing a heroic
path and gaining one talent from it. This chapter
presents six heroic paths:
```

Adolin Kholin, Alethkar’s

most talented young

warrior.

```
Agent. A talented operative who solves problems
with a keen mind or a deft hand. Agent specialties
include the Investigator, Spy, and Thief.
Envoy. An insightful negotiator who adeptly
influences others. Envoy specialties include the
Faithful, Diplomat, and Mentor.
Hunter. A skilled sharpshooter and outdoorsperson
who seeks and eliminates problems. Hunter specialties
include the Archer, Assassin, and Tracker.
Leader. A poised commander who directs and guides
others to be their best. Leader specialties include
the Champion, Officer, and Politico.
Scholar. An adroit thinker who excels at planning and
building. Scholar specialties include the Artifabrian,
Strategist, and Surgeon.
Warrior. A fighter who relies on their skill, brute
strength, or indomitable will. Warrior specialties
include the Duelist, Shardbearer, and Soldier.
Some characters remain focused on these heroic paths
as they gain levels, but as the narrative develops, many
characters eventually bond a spren, swear their First
Ideal, and become Radiant. As detailed in chapters
5–6, Radiant paths contain the powers and abilities a
character can gain through their spren bond, including
surges, Radiant Shardblades, and more.
```

```
Creating Your Hero
The entry for each heroic path begins with an intro-
duction describing its three specialties, recommending
which statistics to prioritize during character creation,
and suggesting several iconic Stormlight characters you
could build with that path. The remainder of each entry
presents the talents for that path, divided by specialty.
See chapter 1 for instructions on how to create your
character and choose your first heroic path.
```

```
Creation Tips
As you create your character, be sure to consider how
your character’s build will serve you in all scene types,
not just combat (see “Scenes” in chapter 9).
You can create characters from any path with nearly
any combination of attributes, skills, and talents, but
some combinations work especially well together. The
general advice in each path’s introduction can help you
get started—but the possibilities are endless, and these
tips might not apply to the specific role you envision
your character playing.
```

```
Chapter 4: Heroic Paths 69
```

```
PETAR PENEV
```

```
Advancing Through a Path
Each path includes a full talent tree for that path’s
specialties. Your character can advance through a talent
tree by gaining a level—and with it, a new talent. When
you acquire a talent, you unlock access to the more
potent talents from deeper in that path.
```

```
Key Talent
When choosing a new talent, the key talent (the top
talent of each path) is always available, provided you
meet any prerequisites (see “Prerequisites” at the end
of chapter 1). Gaining this key talent unlocks access to
the specialties in that path.
You can follow as many heroic paths and specialties
as you wish. You might even decide to follow a powerful
Radiant path (see chapter 5)—if so, its key talent can be
chosen just like those of heroic paths.
Accessing Other Talents
You can also choose talents that lie deeper in your
existing paths, as long as you otherwise meet their
prerequisites. These deeper talents appear below or
beside the talent that unlocks them, connected by a line;
you have access to any talent connected to one you’ve
already gained. (In addition to these lines on the visual
tree, you can check each talent’s text to see which talents
unlock it.)
Talents With Goals
If a talent gives you a particular goal, you must complete
that goal before choosing later talents in that tree. For
example, if you previously chose the Third Ideal talent
from a Radiant path, but you haven’t completed its
“Swear the Third Ideal” goal, you can’t yet choose the
Fourth Ideal, Deepened Bond, or Take Squire talent.
Talents With Duplicate Names
Some talents in different paths share the same name
(for example, the Hardy talent appears in the Agent,
Hunter, Leader, and Warrior paths). If you already have
a talent of the same name, you’re considered to have
that talent in every path, so you can (and must) skip
that duplicate talent in the tree.
```

```
Starting Path and Starting Skill
When you create your character for this game, you
choose your starting path. This first path grants you
one free rank in the starting skill listed at the top of
that heroic path.
If you later branch out into other paths, you don’t
gain the starting skill for those paths, as they aren’t your
starting path. However, as you gain levels, you gain more
skill ranks of your choice; the skills associated with your
paths are a great option for these ranks.
```

```
Talent Summaries
Each path’s talent tree includes a brief summary of
its talents. These are provided for quick reference,
but you’ll need to read the talent’s full text to learn
all the rules associated with it.
```

```
Using Talents
Each talent represents a specific ability or other benefit
you’ve acquired through your experience or training.
This can be an ability you can activate (such as a new
attack), a permanent bonus to your statistics (such as
an increase to your Cognitive defense), or even an effect
that lets you shape the narrative in special ways.
```

```
Anatomy of a Talent
All talents (including those in other chapters) have
the following elements:
Name. The name of the talent.
Prerequisite. To choose a talent, it must be a key
talent or you must’ve already gained a talent linked to
it in the talent tree (see “Advancing Through a Path”).
Additionally, some talents list other prerequisites you
must meet before choosing that talent (see “Prereq-
uisites” at the end of chapter 1). These might include
gaining skill ranks or achieving certain ambitions
within the narrative, such as gaining the backing
of a patron.
Activation. Each talent lists an activation time,
representing how long it takes to initiate or accomplish
the ability granted by that talent (see the upcoming
“Activating a Talent” section). For ease of reference,
the talent tree shows the corresponding icon for that
activation type beside the talent’s name.
Narrative Description. Each talent briefly describes
how its effect might fit within your shared story.
This doesn’t impact the talent’s rules, but it provides
context and flavor to help you, other players, and
the GM imagine how that ability might play out
narratively. Feel free to reflavor these to suit your
character or the situation.
Effect Description. Each talent includes at least one
new ability or other mechanical effect that interacts
with your character’s statistics and abilities. The
talent explains the new rules for this effect (such
as a new way to spend your focus), any tests you or
other characters might need to make for this effect,
how to resolve this effect’s outcome, and other
relevant considerations.
```

**70** Chapter 4: Heroic Paths

```
Activating a Talent
Each talent lists its activation type after its prerequisites.
These activation types include the following:
Action ( ). Many talents require using one or more
actions to activate their effect. To activate these
talent effects, follow the normal rules for actions
(see “Actions and Reactions” in chapter 10).
Free Action ( ). Some talents require activation on
your turn, but since they’re a free action, they don’t
prevent you from doing other things too. These follow
the normal rules for free actions (see “Actions and
Reactions” in chapter 10).
Reaction ( ). Some talents can only be used in
response to a trigger—an effect stated in the talent.
You aren’t required to use the talent when that trigger
occurs, but if you want to, you use your reaction
following the normal rules for reactions (see “Actions
and Reactions” in chapter 10). Some talents allow
you to use a reaction to activate a separate ability that
usually requires an action; when that happens, follow
all that ability’s rules except for its activation time.
Special Activation ( ). Some talents don’t necessarily
cost an action or reaction; instead, you choose to
activate them in other specific ways, such as by
taking a short or long rest, by spending focus as
part of another action, or by simply choosing to
reroll a die (no action required). You can find the
rules for activating these talents in that talent’s
description; if a particular action type isn’t named,
you can freely activate the effect when the described
circumstances occur.
Always Active ( ). Some talents always affect your
character. Sometimes known as “passive” or “ongoing”
effects, these don’t require you to use an action or
do anything else to benefit from them. For example,
a talent that permanently increases your health is
always active and you needn’t choose when you benefit
from it. By contrast, if a talent requires a conscious
choice such as rerolling a die, the talent is considered
a special activation ( ), even if you can do it any time
you encounter that situation.
```

**Terms from Later Chapters**

This chapter uses terms from throughout this book to
describe how talents work, so if you’re reading this chapter
before exploring the remaining chapters, some terms
may be unfamiliar. If you’d like to read ahead, this sidebar
points you to the most important rules that affect your
talents (other than those presented in earlier chapters).
Chapter 9 contains general rules for adventuring. Pay
special attention to the following sections:

◆ (^) **Conditions.** Some talents apply a detrimental or ben-
eficial effect that only lasts a short while. For example,
the Stunned condition temporarily halves the target’s
movement rate.
◆ (^) **Damage, Injur y, and Death.** Damage reduces your
health, though some damage types might affect you
more than others. If your health drops to 0, you gain
the Unconscious condition, and you risk injury or death.
◆ (^) **Resting.** When you take a break from adventuring,
you might recover health, forage for resources, or
gain other benefits.
Chapter 10 contains rules for combat and similar
situations where time is precious. Pay special attention
to the following sections:
◆ (^) **Rounds and Tu r n s.** Combat is divided into rounds.
Each round, you choose whether to take a fast turn
or a slow turn. A fast turn allows you to act before
opponents, while a slow turn grants you more actions
during your turn.
◆ (^) **Actions and Reactions.** Each round, you control what
your character does. You usually take actions on your
turn, but a few special reactions let you act during
another character’s turn.
◆ (^) **Attacking.** You can reduce an enemy’s health by
attacking them using a melee weapon, ranged weapon,
Radiant surges, and more.
◆ (^) **Ta r g e t i n g and Range.** When you target a character
in combat, you might face limitations such as their
location, their distance from you, or whether you can
sense them.
◆ (^) **Movement and Positioning.** Your ability to move across
the battlefield is determined by your movement rate,
nearby terrain, the size of your opponents, and more.
Chapter 11 contains rules for scenes that center on social
interaction. Pay special attention to the following section:
◆ (^) **Resisting Influence.** When you succeed on a skill test
to socially influence a character, they can spend focus
to resist your influence.
_“Do not dismiss your own talents
because you envy those of another.”_
Chapter 4: Heroic Paths **71**

```
Using Talents Outside Combat
Though actions and reactions are often used in combat,
your talents apply in other circumstances too! In these
non-combat scenes, the GM might grant you the talent’s
full effect or adapt it to fit the non-combat situation.
In endeavors and conversations (see chapters 11 and
12), talent effects that require an action or reaction can
be used as a single contribution, while those that require
a free action can be used at any time. Most special acti-
vation talents can be used too, at the GM’s discretion.
In other scenes, the GM determines the amount of
time a talent requires to use.
```

```
Talent Targets
Some talents merely affect you, while others allow you
to interact in special ways with other characters, objects,
or the environment. Effects that target characters and
objects follow the rules in the “Targeting and Range”
section of chapter 10.
Talent and Effect Timing
Talents, NPC abilities, and other effects resolve
at various timing intervals. You can determine
when an effect begins and ends by looking for the
following terms:
When. If an effect occurs “when” something happens,
this means it occurs during the resolution of its trigger.
“Before” and “after” (see below) are sometimes used
to further clarify this timing. If an effect has multiple
distinct steps, the player who controls the effect
decides when to resolve it. For example, if an effect
occurs “when you attack,” you can resolve it at any
point during the attack. However, if it says “when you
attack, before resolving damage,” you must resolve it
sometime between when you declare your attack and
when your target reduces their health.
Before. If an effect occurs “before” something, this
means the effect applies after its trigger has been
declared but before anyone begins resolving that
trigger. For example, if an effect occurs “before you’re
hit by a weapon attack,” you resolve that effect once
the attacker succeeds on their attack test against you,
but before you reduce your health or apply other
effects of that hit.
After. If an effect occurs “after” something, this means
the effect applies immediately after its trigger is
resolved. For example, if an effect occurs “after you’re
hit by a weapon attack,” first you fully resolve the
attack (including reducing your health) then apply
the effect.
```

```
While. If an effect occurs “while” something, this
means the effect only applies during the specified
circumstances, and it ends when those circumstances
do. For example, if an effect occurs “while you
maintain a Basic Lashing,” it remains active while you
maintain the Lashing, then stops at the moment your
Lashing ends.
Until. If an effect occurs “until” a specified time or
trigger, this means the effect ends when the stated
duration does. For example, if an effect occurs “until
the end of your next turn,” it remains active until that
time, then ends.
If two or more of your abilities occur during the
same timing interval, you choose which order to
resolve them in.
Stacking Talents and Effects
The following rules determine if a talent or other effect
can apply multiple times.
Choosing Duplicate Talents
Some talent names appear in several paths—these can’t
be chosen twice. See the earlier “Advancing Through
a Path” section for instructions on how to skip over
these talents.
Duplicate Effect Names
If two similar effects come from abilities with different
names, the effects can stack on a target. However,
if two similar effects come from abilities with the
same name, they can’t simultaneously affect the same
target—even if the talents come from different paths.
For example, if two characters are each using a talent
to grant you an advantage on a test, you gain two
advantages if those two talents have different names;
however, if those two talents have the same name, you
can only gain one advantage.
If two abilities have the same name but their effects
have different durations or intensities, apply the talent
with the most substantial effect. For example, if one
character gives you a +2 bonus and another character
gives you a +3 bonus, you only gain a +3 bonus.
Duplicate Expertises
Many talents grant expertises. If a talent grants a
cultural, utility, weapon, or armor expertise that you
already have, you can instead choose another expertise
from the same category (with your GM’s permission).

BEN MCSWEENEY & SAMI RYTKÖNEN
```

```
Artists of duplicity and sabotage, Agents grasp the
threads of fate in the palms of their hands, waiting for
the perfect moment to pull and unravel the carefully
laid plans of others. Agents can fool even the most
prudent with their clever ruses, swift movements,
and calculated strikes.
Formal education matters little to Agents. Most are
fiercely observant and either self-taught or trained in
action by their crew. Rules and regulations from outside
entities are but playthings to work around or disregard
altogether, and Agents answer only to their own code.
They meet impossible tasks with a sly smile and razor-
sharp wit, living for the thrill of cheating death yet again.
```

```
Agent Specialties
The Agent path presents talents in three specialties:
Investigator. Hunches tend to be unreliable—but
Investigators cultivate trustworthy instincts, learning
to listen, collaborate, and pursue answers to questions
others don’t think to ask.
Spy. To get what they need, Spies plant themselves in
sticky situations, ready to deflect or ease suspicion
when it inevitably sweeps their way.
Thief. Although a quick mind is an invaluable asset,
Thieves train their bodies to keep pace. Whether out
of necessity or ambition, they risk it all to swindle the
insurmountable odds standing between them and
their prize.
```

```
Building an Agent
The following “Agents of Roshar” section suggests
example builds for iconic characters. If you have a
different idea in mind, consider these general tips for
building an effective Agent:
Attributes. It’s usually a good idea to prioritize Aware-
ness, Intellect, and Speed.
Skills. Useful skills include Agility, Deception,
Deduction, Insight, Light Weaponry, and Thievery.
Other Heroic Paths. The Hunter and Scholar paths
make excellent multi-path choices.
Rewards. When choosing rewards, you can’t go wrong
with a bodyguard companion and patrons from the
criminal world or high society.
```

```
Agents of Roshar
If you’d like to draw on the Stormlight Archive for
inspiration, consider these builds for iconic Agent
characters.

```
Azish Constable
Azish constables regularly travel across Azir to enforce
the law. They are authorized to determine innocence
and guilt, though corruption or callousness can
result in grave injustice. Regional assignments cycle
throughout Azir, punctuated by mandatory trips to
designated hubs to receive education on the latest
legislation. On rare occasions, constables are sent to
other member states in the Azish Empire on matters
of great importance.
Building a Constable. Pick human ancestry
and the Azish and Wayfarer cultural expertises. Start
with high Intellect and Willpower. In addition to the
Insight skill rank you gain from Agent, put 2 ranks
into Deduction, and put 1 rank into Insight and
L ig ht Weapon r y.
In addition to the Opportunist (Agent Key) talent,
use your human ancestry to choose the Get ’Em Talking
talent in the Investigator specialty. Finally, choose the
Academic starting kit.
As you level up, consider working toward the Gather
Evidence and Sleuth’s Instincts talents.
Street Urchin
Forsaken by society, street urchins learn early that risk
is synonymous with survival. Circumstances have never
been kind, so they make their own luck and their own
kindness. Some steal just for sustenance, others for
cheeky triumph—either way, street urchins do what they
must to carry on. In the depths of squalor and misery,
hope flickers like a fading sphere, yet they keep fighting
to see another day.
Building a Street Urchin. Pick any ancestry and
any two cultural expertises. Start with high Speed and
Willpower. In addition to the Insight skill rank you gain
from Agent, put 2 ranks into Thievery, and put 1 rank
into Light Weaponry and Stealth.
In addition to the Opportunist (Agent Key) talent,
if you’re a human, choose the Cheap Shot talent in
the Thief specialty. If you’re a singer, choose the
Change Form and Forms of Finesse singer talents,
then later acquire Cheap Shot. Finally, choose either
the Underworld or Prisoner starting kit.
As you level up, consider working toward the Risky
Behavior, Shadow Step, and Trickster’s Hand talents.

Undercover Workform (Listener)
Humans easily mistake workform listeners for the
“parshmen” long exploited and enslaved by Roshar’s
humans. A listener can use this to their advantage
by going undercover in workform, gathering intelli-
gence while suppressing their sorrowful indignation.
Alone in a new place, they watch others who look
like them toil endlessly, confined to slaveform. Some
humans try to be charitable, yet spurn and belittle
out of ignorance. More often, workform listeners find
suspicion and contempt exaggeratedly furrowing the
thin carapace of human faces. Keeping careful watch,
the listeners eagerly await the day they can claim their
freedom, assert their individuality, and exact justice for
their people.
**Building an Undercover Workform.** Pick singer
ancestry, the Listener cultural expertise, and one
human culture you live undercover in. Start with high

In addition to the Opportunist (Agent Key) talent
and the Change Form (Singer Key) talent, use your

Envoys of Roshar
If you’d like to draw on the Stormlight Archive for inspi-
ration, consider these builds for iconic Envoy characters.
```

```
Azish Merchant
Instead of serving a government or religion, merchants
across Roshar preach the good name of commerce,
delivering premium goods to nations near and far.
Merchants must be connoisseurs of international
cultures, social trends, and individual tastes. Adorned
in richly patterned clothing, Azish merchants ply wares
from across the empire and neighboring regions: Marati
rugs, Tukari jewelry, and Liaforan fashions. Whether
they serve the merchant lords of Steen or the viziers of
Azir, these traders are shrewd negotiators trained to
recognize mutually beneficial solutions.
Building a Merchant. Choose human ancestry
and the Azish and Wayfarer cultural expertises. Start
with a high Intellect and Presence. In addition to the
Discipline skill rank you gain from Envoy, put 2 ranks
into Persuasion, and put 1 rank into Lore and Insight.
In addition to the Rousing Presence (Envoy Key)
talent, use your human ancestry to choose the Steadfast
Challenge talent from the Diplomat specialty. Finally,
choose the Academic starting kit.
As you level up, consider working toward the
Collected, Calm Appeal, and Peaceful Solution talents.
Keeper of Songs (Listener)
Every society has Envoys who tend to the spiritual needs
of its people. The listeners rely on keepers of songs to
remember their history, forms, and identity, which were
obscured when their ancestors valiantly defied Odium
and rejected the forms of power. Learning the listeners’
songs and passing them on is a substantial undertaking
most often entrusted from parent to child. Only the
most diligent keepers can recite all the songs perfectly.
Building a Keeper of Songs. Choose singer
ancestry, the Listener cultural expertise, and one other
cultural expertise. Start with a high Strength and
Awareness. In addition to the Discipline skill rank you
gain from Envoy, put 2 ranks into Leadership, and put
1 rank into Discipline and Heavy Weaponry.
In addition to the Rousing Presence (Envoy Key)
talent and the Change Form (Singer Key) talent, use
your singer ancestry to choose the Forms of Wisdom
singer talent so you can eventually take on scholarform;
if you get at least one expertise, select Music, and put
skill ranks in either Discipline or Leadership. Finally,
choose the Artisan starting kit.
As you level up, consider working toward the Instill
Confidence and Rallying Shout talents from the Mentor
specialt y.
```

```
Prominent organizations throughout Roshar appoint
Envoys who vie for resources, curry favor, or offer
service on the organization’s behalf. These stewards
dutifully further the reach of their ideologies through
precise rhetoric, patient attendance, and ceaseless fervor.
Envoys typically subscribe to well-established beliefs
and are careful not to disrupt the integrity of those tenets
with personal desires and ambitions. Wherever they go,
an Envoy stays rooted in their ethos through their strong
connection to the entity they serve. Though an Envoy
considers themself part of something much grander,
their personality shapes the way they fulfill their duties—
and thus they shape the organization they serve.
```

```
Envoy Specialties
The Envoy path presents talents in three specialties:
Diplomat. Stationed abroad, Diplomats are adept at
navigating court politics. They use what they learn
about their host countries to seek more favorable
treatment for their own.
Faithful. For Faithful, worship of the divine permeates
their entire lives. They devote themselves to the
traditions of their faith, demonstrating their
convictions to others through word or deed.
Mentor. More interested in the individual than the
whole, Mentors devote themselves to their wards.
They patiently nurture others toward greatness,
seeing beyond doubts and deficits to stoke each
person’s potential.
```

```
Building an Envoy
The following “Envoys of Roshar” section suggests
example builds for iconic characters. If you have a
different idea in mind, consider these general tips for
building an effective Envoy:
Attributes. It’s usually a good idea to prioritize Presence
and Willpower.
Skills. Discipline is an essential skill for most Envoys.
Other useful skills include Deception, Leadership,
Lore, and Persuasion.
Other Heroic Paths. The Leader and Scholar paths
make excellent multi-path choices.
Rewards. When choosing rewards, you can’t go wrong
with influential patrons.

Vorin Ardent
In the Vorin ardentia, priests conduct rites and rituals
to worship the Almighty and the Heralds on behalf
of the household or nation they serve. Their duties
include burning glyphwards in prayer and performing
other rituals so the nobility they serve needn’t burden
themselves. Each ardent belongs to a devotary and fol-
lows its precepts. Unrestricted by typical Vorin gender
roles, ardents of all genders can pursue various arts and
studies, which they teach to others on request.
Building an Ardent. Choose human ancestry
and the Alethi and Veden cultural expertises. Start
with a high Intellect and Awareness. In addition to
the Discipline skill rank you gain from Envoy, put
2 ranks into Lore, and put 1 rank into Discipline and
L ig ht Weapon r y.
In addition to the Rousing Presence (Envoy Key)
talent, use your human ancestry to choose the Galvanize

```
Hunters of Roshar
If you’d like to draw on the Stormlight Archive for
inspiration, consider these builds for iconic Hunter
characters.
```

```
Emuli Conscript
When new conscripts are drafted into Emul’s military
to fight in the Eighty’s War, they’re given little more
than a bow and arrows. The threat of merciless Tukari
invaders looms day and night, yet the conscripts’
courage remains true. These Emuli must dispatch
enemies before they get close enough to dominate,
not only for the sake of the conscripts themselves,
but for their kingdom’s claim on their hallowed capital,
Sesemalex Dar. The unwavering conscripts remind
all of Roshar that Emuli camaraderie and patriotism
aren’t to be trifled with.
Building a Conscript. Choose human ancestry
and the Azish and Tashikki cultural expertises. Start
with a high Strength and Awareness. In addition to the
Perception skill rank you gain from Hunter, put 2 skill
ranks into Heavy Weaponry, and put 1 skill rank into
Agility and Perception.
In addition to the Seek Quarry (Hunter Key) talent,
use your human ancestry to choose the Tagging Shot
talent in the Archer specialty. Finally, choose the
Military starting kit.
As you level up, consider working toward the
Unrelenting Salvo talent.
Ghostblood Operative
Operatives of the mysterious Ghostbloods are tempted
by the secrets offered by their order, including whispers
of other worlds. Intent on achieving the goals of their
superiors, operatives see those who stand in their way
as collateral damage. They keep their skirmishes in the
shadows and skillfully avoid attention. Within the order,
operatives follow a strict chain of command and are
often audited by higher-ranking members. Loyalty must
be proven regularly, lest a Ghostblood hunter become
Ghostblood prey.
Building a Ghostblood. Choose human ancestry,
the Wayfarer cultural expertise, and one other cultural
expertise. Start with high Strength and Speed. In
addition to the Perception skill rank you gain from
Hunter, put 2 ranks into Light Weaponry, and put
1 rank into Perception and Stealth.
In addition to the Seek Quarry (Hunter Key) talent,
use your human ancestry to choose the Startling Blow
talent in the Assassin path. Finally, choose the Under-
world starting kit.
```

```
The thrill of the chase thrums in a Hunter’s mind
as they patiently surveil. No detail is too small or
insignificant to ignore. Experience teaches the most
important lesson: you don’t have to be more powerful
than your quarry, so long as you’re better prepared.
Through careful planning, Hunters choose when and
where to strike, securing an upper hand through clever
use of traps, high ground, and the element of surprise.
If all goes well, the quarry won’t perceive their assailant
until it’s too late. Some Hunters prefer a clean kill from
afar. Others make their work personal, striking in close
quarters and taking pleasure in their prey’s visceral
panic; nothing feels sweeter than methodical prepar-
ation culminating in an exhilarating onslaught.
```

```
Hunter Specialties
The Hunter path presents talents in three specialties:
Archer. Targeting weak points in an enemy army’s
assault, Archers shape the battlefield before the front-
line confrontation. They steadily unleash a torrent of
arrows to scatter and terrorize foes.
Assassin. Whether commissioned to kill or driven by
their own interests, Assassins exploit weaknesses to
quickly incapacitate their quarry.
Tracker. In untamed wilds, none are more capable
than Trackers. With trusty animal companions at their
sides, they scrounge provisions, deftly cross unfriendly
terrain, and set perilous traps.
```

```
Building a Hunter
The following “Hunters of Roshar” section suggests
example builds for iconic characters. If you have a
different idea in mind, consider these general tips for
building an effective Hunter:
Attributes. It’s usually a good idea to prioritize
Awareness, Strength, and Speed.
Skills. Useful skills include Agility, Perception,
Stealth, Survival, and either Light Weaponry or
Heavy Weaponry.
Other Heroic Paths. The Warrior and Agent paths
make excellent multi-path choices.
Rewards. When choosing rewards, you can’t go
wrong with an animal companion, a grandbow,
or a Shardblade.
```

Unkalaki Kaluk’i’iki

for the gods, kaluk’i’iki are adept at navigating inhosp-
itable conditions. These women are responsible for
leading chull-hunting expeditions, as well as escorting
offworlders safely down ice-laden mountainsides. One
rule remains a crucial lifeline to Unkalaki who venture
beyond the safety of the ocean villages: never disregard
a kaluk’i’iki’s warnings, especially when they don’t seem
to make sense.
Building a Kaluk’i’iki. Choose human ancestry
and the Unkalaki and Wayfarer cultural expertises. Start
with high Strength and Awareness. In addition to the
Perception skill rank you gain from Hunter, put 2 ranks
into Survival, and put 1 rank into Heavy Weaponry and
Perception.

can still die from injuries or for narrative reasons.)
If you ever lose your animal companion, you can bond
with a new animal at an opportunity the GM deems

Deadly Trap
Prerequisite: Survival 1+; Seek Quarry key talent
Activation:
You know how to build traps and snares to catch wildlife—
or even deadlier game!
Using foraged supplies or specialized equipment, you
create and conceal a trap within your reach. Choose an
entangling trap or an impaling trap:
Entangling Trap (Survival vs. Cognitive defense).
You create a trap with rope, debris, or other ensnaring
objects. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 impact damage
and becomes Immobilized for 1 round, then the
trap’s area becomes difficult terrain until the end of
the scene.
Impaling Trap (Survival vs. Physical defense).
You create a trap with caltrops, spikes, or other sharp
objects. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 keen damage
and becomes Afflicted [vital damage equal to 3 + your
ranks in Survival] for 1 round, and you can spend
to inflict an injury on the target.
This trap covers a 5-foot-diameter circle on the ground
or other surface concealing it; the trap remains until
triggered, then it is expended. When a character touches
this surface, the trap triggers. Make an attack using your
Survival against the defense listed for that trap, gaining
an advantage if the target is your quarry. On a hit, the
target suffers the trap’s effects. This attack can’t graze.
You can have a maximum number of active traps
equal to your ranks in Survival. You can’t overlap the
areas of active traps. If another character makes a test

Spiritual defense.
```

Prerequisite: Perception 2+; Deadly Trap talent
Activation:
You’re adept at living off the land, confidently hunting with

die or engage in other activities as usual. When you
make a Survival test to forage for food and water, you
auto matically succeed as long as they exist in your
environment and nothing prevents you from foraging.
Your foraging can sustain a number of characters equal
to your ranks in Survival.
```

```

The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Tracker specialty on the Hunter

```

```
Animal Bond
Prerequisite: Have an animal companion; Seek
Quarry key talent
Activation:
Your animal companion is more than just a friend
or working beast—they’re your partner. They warn
you of danger, anticipate your needs, and follow your
commands ... most of the time, anyway.
When you acquire this talent, it upgrades an animal
companion you’ve gained as a reward (see “Compan-
ions” in chapter 8).
You can communicate simple concepts with your
animal companion, and they generally attempt to help
you as requested. When a scene requires their stat block,
see appendix A, “Animal Companions.”
Your animal companion alerts you of incoming
danger. While you can sense them within 10 feet of
you, each of your defenses increases by 1. When you
move, your animal companion automatically moves
alongside you.
During combat, your animal companion follows
the rules for allied NPCs (see “Rounds and Turns” in
chapter 10). However, if your animal companion hasn’t
yet acted this round, you can use to call on them to act
during your turn. When you do, they gain either or
(your choice) to immediately use actions of your choice,
then at the start of their next turn, they gain that many
fewer than usual.
In addition to the actions in chapter 10 and in your
animal companion’s stat block, they can use the special
Track action:
