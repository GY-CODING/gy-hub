Windrunner Philosophy
“I will protect.”
The Ideals of the Windrunners center around
protection: defending innocents from the horrors of
war, keeping the defenseless from harm, and putting
themselves in danger so that others don’t have to. To
accomplish these goals, Windrunners tend to embrace
military hierarchy and solid command structures. They
prioritize not only individual martial excellence, but a
team who works well together. Windrunners generally
train to become the best duelists and weapon masters
among the Radiant orders, with the discipline to take
orders when necessary.
Beyond the First Ideal (see “Swearing Ideals” earlier
in this chapter), each Ideal follows particular patterns,
but individual Windrunners each express the Ideals
using their own words. The sections below suggest
common phrases you can use to inspire your own oaths.
```

```
The Second Ideal
“I will protect those who cannot protect themselves.”
The Second Ideal obligates you to give people the pro-
tection they need in and out of battle, whether they’re
a noncombatant, a soldier in an unwinnable situation,
or someone in a mental health crisis. This protection
can take any form: engaging in combat, lending an
empathetic ear, or advocating to get them the help you
can’t provide yourself.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Second
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Defend noncombatants, especially at great risk to
yourself or your mission.
◆ (^) Be vigilant for those who may need protection and
support, especially those who may not be able to see
they need it.
**Recommended Heroic Paths for Windrunners**
Though the Windrunners heavily emphasize excellence
in weaponry, their capabilities also make them excellent
scouts, and their history emphasizes leadership. As such,
the following heroic paths can be excellent precursors to
the Windrunner Radiant path:
◆ (^) Agent (Spy)
◆ (^) Envoy (Mentor)
◆ (^) Hunter (Archer)
◆ (^) Leader (Champion or Officer)
◆ (^) Warrior (Duelist or Soldier)
_A gallant, glowing figure dives through the clouds,
accompanied by her flitting honorspren partner, before
coming to a sudden stop just above the ground. The
knight stands protectively in front of a cowering family,
brandishing her weapon at the enemy. No harm will
come to innocents this day, not while the Windrunner
still draws breath.
A Windrunner tears through a hallway surrounded
by enemies. The Radiant first adheres two foes’ weapons
together, then slams another foe into the wall and sticks
them there. Finally, the Windrunner paints Stormlight
onto the floor to trap anyone who attempts to follow them.
But pursuit is unlikely—their foes were too confused by the
Windrunner fighting from the ceiling above.
One by one, a Windrunner touches boulders as tall as
him. The giant pieces of rubble each briefly fly to the side
before once again succumbing to gravity’s rule, getting the
Radiant one step closer to reaching the survivors buried
beneath. In a few more moments, they’re free._
In the modern era, when the average person thinks of
the archetypal Knight Radiant, they picture a Wind-
runner: a hero soaring through the sky who stops at
nothing to see others safe. Windrunners are the scouts
and special forces of the Knights Radiant, wielding the
surges of Adhesion and Gravitation. The first allows
them to create powerful bonds between objects, such
as sticking an enemy’s clothing or weapon to the floor.
They use the second to glide through and above the
battlefield, dynamically changing the direction gravity
affects them.

```
The Third Ideal
“I will protect even those I hate...”
Each Windrunner finishes this oath in their own way.
For some, it ends “... so long as it is right.” For others,
it may be “... even if the one I hate most is myself.” In
any case, the Third Ideal focuses on keeping your oaths
and protecting people despite your own flaws. It requires
deep introspection to understand those flaws and how
they’ve prevented you from protecting people, including
yourself, in the past.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Third
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Confront your biases and flaws, especially as they
relate to your obstacle.
◆ (^) Demonstrate your commitment to protecting
others in spite of your flaws: for example,
you might protect people you dislike or
hate, take steps to move past your
biases, or give those you’ve judged
harshly another chance.
The Fourth Ideal
The Fourth Ideal is unique for each Windrunner, but
it always requires accepting failure. You must forgive
yourself for past failures and accept that though you
can’t save everyone, you must still fight to protect
those you can. This Ideal is about confronting your
own fear of inadequacy, while recognizing that you’re
still just a single person (regardless of the power you
wield). Of course you’ll make mistakes; you can’t allow
fear of doing so to define you and prevent you from
moving forward.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Fourth
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
◆ (^) Fail to protect someone you love, or bear witness to
your inability to keep someone safe despite your best
efforts. Examine this and your similar past failures to
learn what caused that failure: did you do something
wrong, was it a stroke of poor luck, or were you
defeated by a greater foe?
◆ (^) Identify what steps you could’ve taken (if any)
to prevent your failures, then consider how that
knowledge can be applied in the future. Begin
training yourself or seeking the help you need to
bridge those gaps.
◆ (^) Honestly forgive yourself for your failures, and
recognize that, though you’ll fail again in the future,
you must keep moving forward.
Windrunner History
Before the Recreance, the Windrunners were
the Radiants’ scouts and strike teams. They used
Gravitation to surveil from afar, then ferried teams of
Radiants on special missions. The Windrunners also
sometimes operated much like conventional soldier
squads. They were by far the most numerous among
the Radiant orders, with over a hundred members
and countless squires. These numbers were largely
due to the resonance of their two surges, enabling a
Windrunner to take far more Radiant squires than
a knight from another order.
The ancient Windrunners clashed often with the
Skybreakers, usually over philosophical differences: the
Skybreakers dispensed justice according to the exact
letter of the law, while the Windrunners were willing
to disregard laws and logic when doing what they
believed was right. These two ideologies often sparked
Chapter 5: Radiant Paths **199**
STEVE PRESCOTT

```
heated debate, especially when it came to deciding the
fate of the guilty. This dislike between the two orders
persists to the modern day between honorspren and
highspren, the partner spren of these two orders.
Thousands of years after the Recreance, an enslaved
bridgeman named Kaladin bonded the honorspren
Sylphrena, becoming the first Windrunner in the
modern era to speak the Second Ideal; he later swore
the Third Ideal and refounded the Order of Wind-
runners. Most of his bridge crew, Bridge Four, became
his Radiant squires and eventually bonded with their
own honorspren. Due to Kaladin Stormblessed’s own
military experience and the close bonds his bridge crew
formed with each other, the modern Windrunners
embrace a ranked military hierarchy, and even squires
have their own ranking system.
The modern Windrunners primarily serve the
Coalition of Monarchs, performing duties such as
guarding others, transporting people and parcels,
and scouting enemy encampments. When Kaladin
stepped down from active leadership for personal
reasons, he named Sigzil, a Windrunner of the Third
Ideal, as the new companylord. Sigzil has a keen mind
for strategy and logistics, keeping the Windrunners
and their plethora of squires well-organized. Like the
Windrunners of old, they are among the most numerous
of the modern Radiant orders, with nearly fifty full
Windrunners (plus hundreds of squires).
```

```
Honorspren
To become a Windrunner, you must bond with an
honorspren.
Honorspren Appearance
In the Cognitive Realm, honorspren are roughly the
same size as humans, but their white-blue forms glow
faintly without shedding light. Their features are
reminiscent of the Alethi (albeit in blue and white),
and they usually appear to be wearing either military-
like uniforms or flowing robes. This clothing also
glows, as it’s part of their essence, and they have a
limited ability to alter it with a bit of concentration
and Stormlight.
In the Physical Realm, honorspren are partially
translucent and still glow a faint white-blue, but
they’re typically no taller than a single handspan.
Like their windspren cousins, their forms are extremely
malleable; honorspren can resemble flying ribbons,
clouds, fire, and just about anything they can imagine.
A light breeze always appears to be caressing their
form, billowing their hair and clothing (or whatever
lightweight materials appear in their current form).
```

```
To Radiants or the people they may wish to bond,
an honorspren typically displays a miniature version of
their Shadesmar appearance, though some honorspren
can appear at full size. As a Windrunner swears the
higher Ideals, their bonded honorspren gains greater
abilities to customize their appearance in the Physical
Realm; they can become more opaque, and by the
Third Ideal, they can even appear in different colors.
Honorspren Culture
In Shadesmar, honorspren society shares much in
common with the humans of Alethkar—warlike with a
tradition of hierarchy, military excellence, and going on
grand hunts to track and slay massive beasts. Unlike the
Alethi, however, honorspren have a history of isolation-
ism. As direct Splinters of the deceased Shard Honor,
they consider oaths and other promises to be sacred,
and they devotedly follow Honor’s edicts and what they
believe would be his continued interests.
After Honor’s death to Odium, many honorspren
considered the Stormfather to be Honor’s heir. Most
honorspren now worship the Stormfather in Honor’s
place and have become attuned to highstorms; this
has given the honorspren excellent internal clocks, and
they can sense the approach of a highstorm several days
before it arrives.
Honorspren tend more toward emotion than logic,
and they care far less about legality than what they
believe to be moral and right. This leads them to
```

```
an honorspren in The
physical realm
```

**200** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

```
KII W
```

passionately and stubbornly follow their own sense of
right and wrong, even if their viewpoints differ from
fellow honorspren. Honorspren society still values
obedience, hierarchy, and order, but honorspren pride
themselves on being flexible (at least more so than
highspren) when they feel a cause is important enough.

Honorspren Names
Many of the newer generations of honorspren are
named in reference to the wind and storms in the
Storm father’s honor, though older generations share
naming conventions with the ancient nobility. Honor-
spren names include Aeolan, Faenidor, Flurriana, Galin,
Hamistral, Sirocco, Squalti, Tempestiora, Wutheran,
and Zephyrna.

```
Roleplaying an Honorspren
The “Playing with Spren” section provides general
guidance on interacting with your spren. If you bond with
an honorspren, also consider the following.
Perceivability. An honorspren can make themself
visible and audible to whomever they wish; otherwise,
honorspren in the Physical Realm are generally invisible
and inaudible to physical entities who don’t have a specific
ability to perceive spren. However, you can always see
and hear your bonded spren, even in pitch darkness or
gale-force winds. Your spren glows faintly, but they can’t
illuminate their surroundings.
Physical Interaction. Honorspren are mostly insub-
stantial in the Physical Realm, and at first, they have very
little ability to affect their surroundings. They can’t pass
through objects, but their malleable form enables them to
pass through tight spaces like keyholes and closed storm
shutters. Honorspren can interact with lightweight objects
using their Push Object ability.
▷ Push Object (Costs 2 Focus). Your honorspren
slowly pushes an unattended, unsecured object that
weighs no more than 0.1 pounds (but they aren’t strong
enough to carry it). This movement must begin and end
in your spren bond range. If your spren is trying to do so
undetected, the GM might ask you to make a Stealth test
against a DC they set.
Once you speak the Third Ideal, your honorspren can
push objects that weigh up to 1 pound.
▷ or R Te s t Assistance (Costs 1 Focus). Your spren
uses their knowledge and experiences to grant you an
advantage on a specific test. Typically, honorspren can
help with keeping track of time, predicting highstorms,
Leadership tests, and Lore tests related to topics they’re
familiar with, though your spren may be able to help in
additional ways.
```

```
Earning a Bond
The honorspren still remember how many of their
number were killed in the Recreance, and they’re
generally reluctant to subject themselves to the Nahel
bond again. However, when one does look to bond
a human or singer, they generally seek warriors and
leaders who have a strong sense of hierarchy and who do
right by the people under their command. Honorspren
are often inclined to bond with passionate individuals
who have an inherent need to protect the helpless, who
have integrity beyond reproach, who are exceptional
weapon masters, or who honor promises at all costs.
```

Fourth Ideal (Windrunner)
Prerequisite: Level 13+; Speak the Third Ideal
Activation:
You seek to become a full Knight Radiant by speaking the
Fourth Ideal.
You gain the goal “Speak the Fourth Ideal.” After you
complete this goal, you gain the following reward:
```

◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) You can call a swarm of windspren as **_Radiant
Shardplate_** (see chapter 7).
Invested
**Prerequisite:** Reverse Lashing talent
**Activation:**
_You learn to hold and wield greater quantities of Stormlight
within yourself._
When you acquire this talent, your maximum Invest-
iture increases by a number equal to your tier. When
your tier increases by 1, your maximum Investiture
does as well.
Reverse Lashing
**Prerequisite:** Speak the First Ideal
**Activation:**
_You can infuse things with a mix of Adhesion and
Gravitation, giving them a weak gravitational pull
on specific objects._
Before you infuse yourself or an object with a
Basic Lashing using your Gravitation surge, you
can instead infuse the target with a Reverse Lashing
using Adhesion. When you do, declare a type of object
(such as “projectiles,” “gems,” or “keys”) for the
infused target to attract. Only unattended, unsecured
objects can be attracted, and each must be of a size you
can affect with your ranks in Adhesion (see the Surge
Scaling table in chapter 6).
When those objects come within a number of feet
equal to your gravitation rate, they fly straight toward
and stick to the infused target; this can divert ranged
attacks from their intended targets. An attracted object
remains on the infused target until the infusion ends or
until the object is removed.
Second Ideal (Windrunner)
**Prerequisite:** Level 4+; Speak the First Ideal
**Activation:**
_You seek to deepen your Nahel bond with your honorspren
by speaking the Second Ideal._
You gain the goal “Speak the Second Ideal.” After you
complete this goal, you gain the following reward:
◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) Your Enhance action becomes more powerful.
While you have 1 Investiture or more, you can use
Enhance as , and you don’t need to spend Invest-
iture to use this action or maintain its effect.
Take Squire (Windrunner)
**Prerequisite:** Speak the Third Ideal
**Activation:**
_You begin taking other people under your wing, allowing
them to breathe Stormlight and use surges before they’ve
established their own Nahel bond._
After a long rest, choose a companion or player char-
acter you can influence to take as your squire. To choose
them, they must be willing and sapient, you must have
known them for at least 1 game session, and they must
not have bonded a Radiant spren.
When you choose a squire, decide whether you
want to grant them both of your surges, one of them,
or none. That character becomes your squire, gaining
the surges you chose plus the other benefits in the
“Squires” section earlier in this chapter.
You can have a maximum number of squires up
to twice your level. If you already have the maximum
number of squires, you must choose one to dismiss as
your squire before choosing a new one.
Third Ideal (Windrunner)
**Prerequisite:** Level 8+, Speak the Second Ideal
**Activation:**
_You seek to advance your Nahel bond even further by
speaking the Third Ideal._
You gain the goal “Speak the Third Ideal.” After you
complete this goal, you gain the following reward:
◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) You can summon your spren as a **_Radiant Shard­
blade_** (see chapter 7).
Wound Regeneration
**Prerequisite:** Invested talent
**Activation:**
_You can use Stormlight to rapidly recover from injuries._
When you use the Regenerate free action, you can
spend Investiture to instantly recover from an injury
of your choice (either instead of or in addition to
healing yourself ). Spend 2 Investiture to recover from
a temporary injury, or spend 3 Investiture to recover
from a permanent one.

BEN MCSWEENEY & DARREN CALVERT

```
Each Bondsmith is partnered with one of the great
ones of the spren: the Stormfather, the Sibling, or the
Nightwatcher. These spren each have unique abilities,
many of which they grant to their Bondsmith. For
example, the Stormfather’s Bondsmith can “ride”
the highstorm alongside him to gain a tactical view of
the landscape wherever the highstorm is. Meanwhile,
the Sibling’s Bondsmith is aware of and can precisely
control the systems within the tower-city of Urithiru.
The bonded spren also determines the type of Invested
light the Bondsmith uses to power their abilities and can
grant to others: Stormlight for the Stormfather, Tower-
light for the Sibling, and Lifelight for the Nightwatcher.
Bondsmiths also can combine their powers with
those of other Radiant orders in special ways. For
example, they can enhance an Elsecaller’s abilities to
allow many people to move between planets. Or when
working alongside a Lightweaver, the Stormfather’s
Bondsmith can create a holographic map to show
precise troop placements as they were the last time the
highstorm passed.
Despite their extraordinary powers, Bondsmiths
aren’t nearly as suited for combat as other orders; they
can’t summon a Radiant Shardblade or Shardplate, and
their powers are much better suited to uniting others
than dividing them.
```

```
Bondsmith Philosophy
“I will unite.”
The highest calling of any Bondsmith is to foster unity
and bring people together. Sometimes this can manifest
as seeking an end to war and facilitating eras of peace,
or as gathering a coalition of disparate factions for
a common goal (such as defeating a shared enemy).
Though the general themes of each Bondsmith’s oaths
are roughly the same, the three Bondsmith spren each
are so different in nature and personality that the
individual words of their Ideals can present entirely
differently. (See “Swearing Ideals” earlier in this
chapter for details on the First Ideal.)
```

```
The Second Ideal
“I will unite instead of divide. I will bring people together.”
The Second Ideal obligates the Bondsmith to seek peace
and cooperation, to resolve conflicts as nonviolently
as possible, and to mediate disputes as best they can.
These concepts apply to creating unity at all scales,
from individuals to kingdoms. This Ideal requires the
Bondsmith to consider the methodology behind how
they engage in conflict and understand the importance
of service.
```

```
Ash drifts across the ruined battlefield. Bleary-eyed soldiers
from many different cultures pick through the rubble in
front of a destroyed palace, its facade torn asunder hours
earlier by a stone monstrosity. From the ash emerges a regal
figure; she lays her hand on each soldier in turn, speaking
in their native tongues and reassuring them victory is truly
at hand. She then strides up to the palace where a soldier is
solemnly piecing back together its shattered stone doorway.
The Bondsmith places her hands against the fragments, and
slowly, the once-glorious palace entry begins to knit back
together. The intricately carved friezes that once adorned
its surface reform once again—a symbol that maybe, after
everything, the people can still rebuild.
There are never more than three full Bondsmiths at
a time, each bonded with one of three unique spren.
These rarest of Radiants are the heart, soul, and com-
manders of the Knights Radiant, and they’re typically
the most highly protected and regarded of the orders.
Bondsmiths use the surges of Tension and Adhesion,
which generally alter the rigidity of objects and bind
them to each other. However, Bondsmiths wield these
powers to a much greater degree—and with slightly
different properties—than do the other orders who share
them. As a result, Bondsmiths are capable of doing
incredible things with the nature of oaths, bonds, and
power. Notably, they can alter and forge spiritual Con-
nection; this power can be as innocuous as Connecting
with someone to speak an unshared language, but at
higher Ideals, it can drain Stormlight from a foe’s body
or forcibly alter the bond between a Radiant and their
spren. Bondsmiths can also mold the Spiritual Realm to
create visions, into which they can bring others.

**206** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

The Third Ideal
_“I will take responsibility for what I’ve done. If I must fall,
I will rise each time a better person.”_
Broadly, the Third Ideal is about becoming a better
person and leader over time. It requires the Bondsmith
to acknowledge the mistakes they’ve made, and to learn
from these missteps to better serve their people and keep
their oaths.

```
The Fourth Ideal
No matter how deft of a mediator a person is, conflict
is inevitable, and it all too often results in bloodshed.
If negotiations break down and the Bondsmith needs to
marshal their forces and fight, the Fourth Ideal requires
recognition that all life is precious. Every person has
their own life and people who care for them, and they
will leave a hole when they are gone. This is true not
only of the people in the Bondsmith’s service, but also
of the enemy they are fighting. A Bondsmith can’t
allow themself to make their enemy faceless; they must
consider the costs of every move they make to minimize
the loss and ruination of life.
```

```
Bondsmith History
The term “Bondsmith” predates even the ancient
Radiants; it originally referred to a person who could
manipulate bonds and Connection. Such a Bondsmith
discovered and facilitated the first spren bonds, even-
tually resulting in the founding of the Knights Radiant.
The Shard Honor, however, sought to place reasonable
restrictions on Surgebinding; he believed it necessary
to have the powerful Bondsmiths as a Radiant order,
but he ensured that they were limited in number.
Honor granted only three unusually powerful spren
the capability of creating a Bondsmith with their Nahel
bond: the Stormfather (who was Honor’s own Splinter),
the Nightwatcher (Cultivation’s Splinter), and the
Sibling (a spren made equally from both of the Shards’
powers). In the centuries leading up to the Recreance,
the number of Bondsmiths varied, sometimes falling
as low as one.
Despite the Bondsmiths being limited to three full
Radiants, they could take squires, who they typically
chose from the elite warrior unit assigned to protect
them. These squires wielded the order’s two surges
(but without their Bondsmith’s unique abilities).
Beyond squires, the Bondsmiths typically also had
retinues of attendants and guards, many of whom took
Radiant oaths to demonstrate loyalty, though they had
```

```
no expectation of gaining powers of their own. Some
ancient Radiants viewed these oaths as the purest form
of Radiance, and such loyal attendants were considered
members of the Order of Bondsmiths despite their lack
of Radiant powers.
In times of both peace and war, the Bondsmiths
commanded the Knights Radiant, resolved disputes
between nations, and helped to establish functioning
governments in places that didn’t yet have them or
that lost their leadership in war. The Bondsmiths
also mediated conflicts between the various Radiant
orders, as these often clashed and argued with each
other (especially the Skybreakers who policed the
other orders).
In the thousands of years since the Recreance, only
two Bondsmiths have appeared. The first of these was
Dalinar Kholin—former highprince of Alethkar, now
king of Urithiru and high commander of the modern
Knights Radiant. During the War of Reckoning at the
Shattered Plains, Dalinar began experiencing strange
visions during highstorms, granting him lost know-
ledge of the ancient Radiants. He learned of the threat
of a horrible enemy that all the nations of Roshar
needed to band together to defeat. When the listeners
were tricked into unleashing the Everstorm and
beginning the True Desolation, Dalinar recognized
what the visions had warned him of. He demonstrated
his commitment to unity by establishing the Coalition
of Monarchs, and he formed a Nahel bond with the
Stormfather.

GM Tip: Playing with Bondsmiths
Only three Bondsmiths exist at any given time, and
wielding their extraordinary powers as a player character
would unbalance gameplay. Consequently, Bondsmiths
aren’t presented in a playable form in this book. However,
if you wish for players in your game to experience
Bondsmith powers, you can do so through rewarding them
with a patron (see chapter 8, “Goals and Rewards”) with
the following benefit.
Bondsmith Squire. If your patron is a Bondsmith, you
can become a squire (see “Squires” earlier in this chapter)
with access to the surges of Adhesion and Tension.
Due to your Bondsmith’s powers over Connection, you
maintain your squire abilities for much longer when far
away from your patron. While 50 miles or more away from
your Bondsmith patron, you maintain your squire abilities
for a number of months equal to your patron’s tier.

## Surges

◆ (^) When you make a test with a surge, use its surge
skill (for example, making an Abrasion test like
you would an Agility test).
Gaining Surge Ranks
Unlike normal skills, you can’t access a surge until your
Radiant path (or another rule) gives you at least 1 rank
in it. Once this happens, you can use the basic version of
the surge. During character advancement, you can gain
additional ranks in your surge skills in the same way you
do for other skills.
**On Your Character Sheet.** When you gain your
first rank in a surge skill, add that surge skill to your
character sheet on the blank lines beneath your skills,
then record your skill modifier next to it.
Surge Effects
Surges generally follow the same rules as talents (see
“Using Paths and Talents” in chapter 4 and “Using
Radiant Paths” in chapter 5). When you’re using a
surge, the following additional rules determine how
large and powerful your surge is, as well as how long
its effects last.
Surge Scaling
As you gain more ranks in a surge skill, this not only
increases your skill modifier for tests, but it empowers
your surge’s effects.
Surge Dice
When using surges (or their talents), you’ll sometimes
roll dice to determine effects like damage dealt or health
recovered. When indicated, the size of these **surge dice**

Roshar, Stormlight powers incredible
Invested abilities known as Surgebinding.
There are ten surges in total, each
controlling a fundamental force of nature. By wielding
Investiture in the form of Stormlight, Surgebinders
can perform wondrous feats such as defying gravity,
melting the very stone of the earth, or creating illusions
out of thin air.
If you wish to wield these powers yourself,
you’ll need to become a Radiant (see chapter 5) by
forming a bond with a spren, choosing talents from
a Radiant path, and swearing oaths to follow your
order’s Ideals.
```

```
Using Surges
Your Radiant path grants access to the two surges
wielded by your order (see the Radiant Orders table in
chapter 5). For example, when an Edgedancer speaks
the First Ideal, they gain the Abrasion and Progression
surge skills. This chapter presents the basic version of
each surge, as well as talent trees to upgrade each surge.
```

```
Surge Skills
When you speak your order’s First Ideal, you gain both
of your order’s surges, and you add those surges to the
blank skill lines on your character sheet. Each surge
skill works much like other skills:
```

◆ (^) Each surge has an associated attribute (stated
in parentheses in that surge’s title). As usual,
this attribute determines whether a surge skill is
categorized as physical, cognitive, or spiritual.
◆ (^) To determine your skill modifier for a surge
skill, combine your ranks in that skill with the
corresponding attribute score.

```
surge to sustain its effects until all infused Investiture
is expended.
As you infuse Investiture and then drain that infusion
with your surge, be sure to track how much Investiture
remains infused so you know when the effect ends.
Infusing Yourself
If a surge allows you to infuse yourself, you don’t need
to spend extra Investiture up front to sustain the surge
for more than one round. Instead, simply spend the
needed amount for the current round, and the surge
automatically draws from your current Investiture
in future rounds until you choose to end the surge
(no action required).
Expending Infused Investiture
Regardless of whether a surge is drawing from your own
Investiture or whether you’ve infused an object, a surge
usually expends 1 Investiture at the start of each of your
turns. Even if you become Unconscious, your surges can
continue, expending Investiture as they do.
Some surges can expend additional Investiture for
heightened effects. When they do, your current Invest-
iture (or the Investiture infused in an object) is reduced
by that much. This can be powerful, but it also drains
your Stormlight and ends the infusion sooner.
By contrast, some talents allow your surges to use
Stormlight more efficiently. For example, the Master
of the Skies talent allows you to use Gravitation to fly
indefinitely without spending additional Investiture
each turn.
Ending a Surge
When a surge runs out of Investiture (whether it’s
drawing from your own Investiture or an infused
object), or when you choose to end a surge on yourself
(no action required), that infusion and the surge’s effects
end. For example, if you use the Gravitation surge to
infuse an object with 1 Investiture, the Investiture runs
out one round later, at the start of your next turn—and
when it does, the surge ends. But if you instead infuse
that object with 2 Investiture, the surge lasts two
rounds instead.
Adding to an Infusion
At the start of your turn, but before your infusions
expend Investiture (and potentially end), you can use
to infuse any amount of additional Investiture in an
infusion and maintain its effect. To do so, you must be
within the range required to create that infusion.

scale with your ranks in that surge, as shown on the
Surge Scaling table.
Surge Size
Many surges can only affect characters and objects up
to a certain size (see “Size and Space” in chapter 10),
or only affect an area up to that same size (see “Area
Effects” in chapter 10). This surge size increases
with your ranks in that surge, as shown on the Surge
Scaling table.
Unless otherwise specified, you can’t infuse an
object if either its width, length, or height exceeds
your surge size.
```

```
Surge Scaling
Ranks Die Size Effect Size
1 d4 Small (2.5 feet)
2 d6 Medium (5 feet)
3 d8 Large (10 feet)
4 d10 Huge (15 feet)
5 d12 Gargantuan (20 feet)
```

```
Surge Attacks
If your surge allows you to make an attack, these
follow the standard rules in the “Attacking” section of
chapter 10. Keep the following rules in mind:
```

◆ (^) If you can’t sense the target, your test gains a
disadvantage.
◆ (^) On a hit, add your surge skill modifier to the damage.
If you want, you can spend to turn your hit into a
critical hit.
◆ (^) On a miss, you can spend 1 focus per target to
graze instead.
Surge Infusions and Durations
Some surges have ongoing effects that are maintained
until the Stormlight fueling them runs out. Surges
on yourself draw from your current Investiture, while
surges on other objects need you to **infuse** them with
Stormlight (allowing the surge to continue without
your immediate presence). You can have multiple
active  **infusions**.
**Infusing an Object**
When a surge requires you to infuse an object, spend
the amount of Investiture indicated, subtracting it from
your current Investiture value. That much Investiture
is now infused into the surge effect, allowing the

Anatomy of a Surge
The remaining sections of this chapter describe each
surge skill, including the following information:
Title (Attribute). Each entry’s title states the name
of that surge skill, then in parentheses, that surge’s
associated attribute (which you’ll use to calculate your
skill modifier).
Surge. Each surge grants a basic ability that operates
much like a talent. This ability lists the two Radiant
orders that can use this surge and the number of
actions needed to activate it, followed by the basic
rules for that surge. Radiants can grant these basic
surges to their squires (but squires can’t use the talents
that upgrade that surge).
Using the Surge. After each surge’s basic rules, this
section provides more guidance on various ways you
might use the surge.
Talents. Finally, each entry presents a list of talents you
can use to upgrade that surge. You can’t choose these
until you speak the First Ideal for that Radiant path.
These talents follow the rules in the “Using Paths and
Talents” section of chapter 4.
```

```
Duration Outside Combat
Even though the surge rules use combat-focused
language (like “round”) to describe how long a surge
lasts, you can use surges outside of combat. To keep the
narrative simple across different scene types, assume
that “one round” represents the following:
Combat. A surge expends Investiture once per round
of combat, at the start of your turn—so once per
10 seconds.
Conversation. A surge expends Investiture once per
round of contributions—so about once per minute.
Endeavor. A surge expends Investiture once per round
of contributions—this time varies dramatically by
endeavor, anywhere from 1 to 10 minutes.
Outside of Scenes. If not in a scene, assume each
“round” of Investiture lasts about 10 minutes.
If a surge continues across multiple scenes, it’s up to
the GM how long it lasts in the narrative. This largely
depends on how involved the surge is in the new scene.
For example, if you use Adhesion to stick a book to the
ceiling, and then a fight breaks out down the hall, the
surge’s duration isn’t immediately relevant to the
narrative; in this case, the GM might let it expend
Investiture just once every 10 minutes (so everyone
can focus on the fight instead of tracking an unrelated
surge). But if a fight breaks out in the same room as the
book, or if the conflict centers on people wanting the
book, the surge’s duration suddenly matters to the
narrative; in this case, the GM might decide the surge
expends Investiture every round of combat.
```

```
Using Surges Creatively
The description for each surge skill lists its basic
capabilities and provides mechanics for common uses.
Meanwhile, surge talents expand your options for specific
surge techniques. However, you aren’t limited to these
rules! With your GM’s approval, you can use your surges to
attempt nearly anything.
For these more open-ended uses of surges, you’ll still
need to make a skill test and spend Investiture (in an
amount determined by your GM). When determining the
outcome, the GM should refer to the Surge Scaling table at
the beginning of this chapter; this table provides guidance
on how large of an area you can affect with your current
ranks, as well as the relative strength of your damage rolls
or similar effects.
As with any skill test, the GM sets the DC, raises the
stakes when appropriate, and narrates the results of the
test. Improvising creative Surgebinding techniques can
be one of the most memorable moments in a Stormlight

Abrasion
speed
The surge of Abrasion alters the frictional force on an
object’s surface, usually by nearly eliminating it.
Abrasion Surge
Radiant Orders: Dustbringer, Edgedancer
Activation:
Spend 1 Investiture or more to infuse an object or
portion of a surface within your reach, making it nearly
frictionless; to do so, you must have a hand free and
touch the target. This infusion uses 1 Investiture each
round, and for the duration, the object or surface
slides f reely.
This target can’t exceed the surge size for your ranks
in Abrasion (see the Surge Scaling table at the beginning
of this chapter).
You can’t use this surge on other characters, Invested
objects (like Shardplate), or objects that have been
infused with Stormlight (like infused spheres or objects
affected by surges).
Alternatively, you can infuse your body with Abra-
sion, regardless of your size, spending 1 Investiture each
round to maintain the surge. While infused, you can
freely change which parts of your body are frictionless,
and you can use Skate and Slide until the surge ends:
▷ Skate. You can skate across the ground as if it were ice.
Spend 2 focus to Move (as ) in a straight line on the ground.
You can accomplish this frictionless movement without
practice—though you’ll need experience to do it gracefully!
Slide. You instinctively remove friction from parts of
your body to more easily slide over obstacles or escape
bonds. You count as one size smaller when squeezing
through spaces, and you gain an advantage on tests to
escape restraints that hold you via friction or pressure.

Abrasion on Others
While you can’t directly target other characters with
Abrasion, you can target objects they’re holding or
wearing. If a character is willing, you can easily infuse
objects in their possession.
To infuse an object held by an unwilling character or
to infuse a surface that’s supporting most of their weight
(such as the ground they’re standing on or a wall they’re
climbing), you must succeed on an Abrasion test against
the target’s Physical defense. On a failure, you don’t
infuse that object and you don’t spend Investiture on
the attempt.
```

```
Interacting With Slick Surfaces
When another character steps on or otherwise interacts
with a surface or object you made slick with Abrasion,
it’s difficult to stay on their feet or hold on to the slippery
object. The character must make an Agility test opposed
by your Abrasion. If they succeed, they stay on their feet
or hold on to the object; otherwise, they fall Prone or
drop the object.
```

```
Abrasion Talents
The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Abrasion talent tree for the Dust-
bringer and Edgedancer paths.
Distant Surgebinding
Prerequisite: Reverse Abrasion talent
Activation:
You can infuse targets from a greater distance.
You can use your surges and their talents as though your
reach is 20 feet, and you don’t need to touch the target.
```

```
Frictionless Motion
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You become increasingly adept at using Abrasion to glide
through your environment.
While infused with Abrasion, your movement rate
increases by 10 feet, and you ignore the Slowed
condition when imposed by difficult terrain, climbing,
crawling, and swimming.
Graceful Skating
Prerequisite: Frictionless Motion talent
Activation:
You dynamically skate around the battlefield, easily
slipping away from your foes.
When you Skate, you aren’t restricted to moving in
a straight line.
```

**abrasion**

```
Frictionless Motion
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
While infused with Abrasion,
increase your movement by
10 and ignore Slowed.
```

```
Reverse Abrasion
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
You can increase the friction
of an object or area, canceling
difficult terrain and giving an
advantage to interact with it.
```

```
Graceful Skating
When you Skate and use its
Move free action, you aren’t
restricted to moving in a
straight line.
```

```
Stormlight
Reclamation
At the start of your turn,
you can end any number
of infusions to regain their
remaining Investiture.
```

```
Slippery Target
While infused with Abrasion,
attacks can’t graze you and
Reactive Strikes against you
gain a disadvantage.
```

```
Distant Surgebinding
Use your surges and their
talents as though your reach
is 20 feet.
```

```
Slick Combatant
While infused with Abrasion,
you can interrupt a Move with
other actions. Deal extra
damage on a mid-movement
attack.
```

```
Smooth Operator
While you have Investiture,
you are infused with Abrasion
and it costs you 1 fewer focus
to Skate.
```

DEANDRA SCICLUNA

```
Reverse Abrasion
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
Instead of making objects frictionless with Abrasion, you
can now increase friction.
When you infuse an object or surface with Abrasion,
you can choose to increase the infused target’s friction
instead of reducing it, making it easier to grip and
traverse. When a character interacts with such an object,
they gain an advantage on Agility and Athletics tests
made to do so. When a character moves across such a
surface, they ignore any Slowed condition the surface
would normally apply (such as due to climbing or
difficult terrain).
```

```
Slick Combatant
Prerequisite: Slippery Target talent
Activation:
You are poetry in motion, able to perform nearly any feat
without slowing down.
When you Skate or otherwise Move while infused with
Abrasion, you can interrupt your movement at one or
more points, use other actions as if you’d finished your
Move, then use your remaining movement as if you were
still in the middle of that Move action.
Once per round, when you make a melee weapon
attack after starting that Move but before finishing it,
you can roll an extra 1d4 damage for that attack. The
size of this die increases with your ranks in Abrasion:
at 2 ranks, roll an extra 1d6 damage (instead of 1d4),
and so on. However, if you add this damage die, the
GM can spend C from the attack test to cause you to
fall Prone and immediately end your Move action.
```

```
Slippery Target
Prerequisite: Graceful Skating talent
Activation:
You make yourself so slick that glancing and hasty blows
slide right off you.
While you are infused with Abrasion, attacks can’t graze
you and Reactive Strikes against you gain a disadvantage.
```

```
Smooth Operator
Prerequisite: Distant Surgebinding talent or
Slippery Target talent
Activation:
You’ve become so efficient at infusing yourself with
Abrasion that it becomes subconscious, allowing you
to slip around with effortless grace.
While you have 1 Investiture or more, you gain the
benefits of being infused with Abrasion without
spending Investiture, and it costs you 1 fewer
focus to Skate.
Stormlight Reclamation
Prerequisite: Reverse Abrasion talent
Activation:
You can reclaim Stormlight from active infusions.
After your infusions expend their infused Investiture at
the start of your turn, you can end any number of those
infusions within your reach, recovering all remaining
Investiture they were infused with.
```

Her powers manifested as the
ability to slide across objects without
truly touching them. She could
become really, really slick—which
was handy, because soldiers tried
to snatch her as she rounded the
Alethi army. They grabbed at her
unbuttoned overshirt, her arm, her
hair. They couldn’t hold her. She
just slid away. It was like they were
trying to grab hold of a song.

```
Adhesion
presence
The surge of Adhesion binds things together. These can
be physical objects, or for more advanced Surgebinders
like Bondsmiths, spiritual Connections. Adhesion
infusions are most commonly used to create a Full
Lashing , in which the Surgebinder adheres two
physical objects together by manipulating air pressure
and resistance.
Adhesion Surge
Radiant Orders: Bondsmith, Windrunner
Activation:
To perform a Full Lashing, spend 1 Investiture or more,
infusing it into two unsecured objects within your
reach and within 5 feet of each other; you must have
a hand free and touch the targets. The infusion uses
1 Investiture each round, and the two objects become
stuck together for the duration.
Each object you target can’t exceed the surge size
for your ranks in Adhesion (see the Surge Scaling table
at the beginning of this chapter).
If you wish, one of these two objects can instead
be the ground, wall, ceiling, or similar surface; you
can target this surface regardless of its size. You can’t
use this surge on characters, Invested objects (like
Shardplate), or objects that have been infused with
Stormlight (like infused spheres or objects affected
by surges).
```

```
Using Adhesion
In addition to the basic surge rules above, this section
provides more guidance on using or interacting with this
surge in your game.
```

```
Adhesion on Others
While you can’t target characters with Adhesion,
you can target objects they’re holding or wearing. If a
character is willing, you can easily infuse objects in
their possession.
To perform a Full Lashing on one or more objects
an unwilling character is holding or wearing, you must
succeed on an Adhesion test against the target’s Physical
defense. On a failure, you don’t infuse those objects and
you don’t spend Investiture on the attempt.
```

```
You can use this surge in countless creative ways, and
it’s up to you and your GM to decide how to resolve each
situation. For example, if you Lash your opponent’s boot
to the ground, they might become Immobilized until
they manage to remove the boot. Or if you Lash their
bracer to their pants, they might gain a disadvantage on
tests using that arm until they disentangle themselves.
```

```
Breaking a Full Lashing
A Full Lashing is quite strong and the Lashed objects
themselves usually break apart before the bond does.
A skilled wielder of Adhesion knows which objects (and
their parts) stand up best to attempts to separate them.
A character can try to break apart two objects you’ve
Lashed together. To do so, they Use a Skill to make
an Athletics test opposed by your Adhesion. If they
succeed, they break the Lashing (or the object, at the
GM’s discretion) and the infusion ends.

Adhesion Talents
The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Adhesion talent tree for the
Windrunner path.
```

```
Adhesive Trap
Prerequisite: Binding Shot talent
Activation:
You can infuse Adhesion into surfaces, causing anyone
who touches them to become stuck.
When you use Adhesion, you can choose to infuse
no objects, and instead only infuse a portion of one
surface, up to the size you can affect with your ranks
in Adhesion.
When another character touches this infused
area, they become subject to a Full Lashing with that
surface for the duration of the infusion, and your test
to Lash them in this way automatically succeeds. For
example, a character becomes Lashed to the surface
if they’re touching it when you infuse it, if they later
touch it while moving through its space, or if they’re
forcibly moved into its space (such as with a gravi-
tational Lashing).
Binding Shot
Prerequisite: Binding Strike talent
Activation:
You “paint” your ammunition with Adhesion before
throwing or firing it at a target, transferring the infusion
to one of your target’s possessions.
You can use Binding Strike when you hit with a ranged
attack at any distance, and you don’t need to touch the
infused targets or have a hand free.
```

```
Binding Strike
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You can seamlessly use Adhesion while performing your
melee attacks.
After you hit with a melee attack, you can spend or
2 focus to use Adhesion, infusing Investiture as usual
but without spending an action. At least one target must
be an object the target is holding or wearing, and you
automatically succeed on the test to infuse it. As usual,
the other object or surface must be within 5 feet of the
first object, but you don’t need to touch it or have a
hand free.
Distant Surgebinding
Prerequisite: Stormlight Reclamation talent
Activation:
You can infuse targets from a greater distance.

Extended Adhesion
Your Full Lashings only expend
1 Investiture per number of
rounds equal to your ranks in
Adhesion.
```

```
Adhesive Trap
You can infuse Adhesion into
surfaces. Characters who
touch the infused surface
become Fully Lashed to it.
```

```
Living Adhesion
You can use Adhesion on
characters. When Lashed to
something larger, they are
Restrained, their physical
tests gain a disadvantage, and
attacks against them gain an
advantage.
```

```
Superior Bond
Automatically succeed on an
opposed test to maintain Full
Lashings against characters
with Strength no higher than
your ranks in Adhesion.

Use your surges and their
talents as though your reach
is 20 feet.
```

```
Binding Shot
You can use Binding Strike
when you hit with a ranged
attack.
```

**216** Chapter 6: Surges

```
You can use your surges and their talents as though your
reach is 20 feet, and you don’t need to touch the target.
(As usual, if you adhere two objects together, they must
be within 5 feet of each other.)
Extended Adhesion
Prerequisite: Distant Surgebinding talent
Activation:
```

_Your Full Lashings use less Stormlight, allowing them to
last much longer._
When you perform a Full Lashing, instead of the
infusion using 1 Investiture per round, it expends
1 Invest iture per number of rounds equal to your
ranks in Adhesion. For example, if you have 3 ranks
in Adhesion, those infusions expend Investiture once
every 3 rounds.

```
Living Adhesion
Prerequisite: Extended Adhesion talent
Activation:
```

_You can apply Adhesion directly to other living beings,
sticking their bodies to surfaces._
You can use Adhesion on characters, making a test
as if you were targeting an object in their possession.
When you Lash a character to an object or surface
that’s larger than them, that character becomes
Restrained, they gain a disadvantage on all physi-
cal tests, and all attack tests against them gain an
advantage.
Stormlight Reclamation
**Prerequisite:** Speak the First Ideal
**Activation:**

_You can reclaim Stormlight from active infusions._

```
After your infusions expend their infused Investiture at
the start of your turn, you can end any number of those
infusions within your reach, recovering all remaining
Investiture they were infused with.
```

```
Superior Bond
Prerequisite: Adhesive Trap talent or Extended
Adhesion talent
Activation:
```

_Your Full Lashings can be broken only by the strongest
of individuals._
When a character attempts to break one of your Full
Lashings, if their Strength attribute is lower than or
equal to your ranks in Adhesion, you automatically
succeed on the opposed test without either of
you rolling.

```
Cohesion
willpower
The surge of Cohesion allows you to alter objects down
to their very axi—the particles that make up all matter.
Often known as Stoneshaping , Cohesion allows even
its most inexperienced wielders to mold stone as if it
were soft clay.
Cohesion Surge
Radiant Orders: Stoneward, Willshaper
Activation:
Infuse 1 Investiture or more into an unattended object
or portion of a surface within your reach that is made
of stone; to do so, you must have a hand free and touch
the target. This infusion uses 1 Investiture each round,
and for the duration, the stone becomes moldable and
soft like clay. When you activate this surge, you can
immediately form the stone into a rough shape as part
of that action, but any elaborate molding requires more
time (see “Shaping Stone”).
This object or portion of the surface can’t exceed
the surge size for your ranks in Cohesion (see the Surge
Scaling table at the beginning of this chapter).
You can’t use this surge on characters, Invested
objects (like Shardplate), or objects that have been
infused with Stormlight (like infused spheres or objects
affected by surges).
```

```
Using Cohesion
In addition to the basic surge rules above, this section
provides more guidance on using or interacting with this
surge in your game.
```

```
Shaping Stone
You can touch Cohesion-infused stone and mold it into
any shape you desire; when that infusion ends, the stone
resolidifies in its new shape, strong as before. You can
briefly shape the stone when you activate the surge,
but more elaborate reshaping requires additional time.
In combat, this usually requires an additional action
to Interact (for moderate reshaping) or Use a Skill (if
your creation is intricate enough to require a Cohesion
skill test; the GM sets the DC based on how elaborate
```

```
Chapter 6: Surges 217
```

```
of an object you’re creating). At the GM’s discretion,
some shaping tasks might take significantly more time,
potentially requiring labor outside of combat.
Cohesion on Others
While it’s simple to melt and reshape unattended
stone, trying to use it against opponents is more
difficult. To infuse an object held by an unwilling
character or to infuse a surface that’s supporting most
of their weight (such as the ground they’re standing
on), you must succeed on a Cohesion test against
the target’s Physical defense. On a failure, you don’t
infuse that object and you don’t spend Investiture
on the attempt.
You can use this surge in countless creative ways,
and it’s up to you and your GM to decide how to
resolve each situation. For example, you might infuse
the ground under your opponent’s feet, causing them
to sink them into the earth and become Slowed by
the quagmire. Or you might soften a portion of a
```

```
stone wall, collapsing it atop them. You might even
smear soft stone over a weapon they’re holding, giving
it the Heavy trait with a value equal to your ranks
in Cohesion.
Escaping Solid Stone
When a Cohesion infusion runs out, the stone returns
to its previously rigid state. When this happens, any
character or object at least partially within it becomes
Immobilized; if enough of their body is encased,
they might also become Restrained. To free such a
character or object, the trapped character or another
character within reach must Use a Skill, making
an Athletics test opposed by your Cohesion. If they
succeed, they slip out. Otherwise, they must be dug
out, which can take 10 minutes or much longer,
depending on the situation.
```

```
Cohesion Talents
The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Cohesion talent tree for the Stone-
ward and Willshaper paths.
```

```
Flowing Earth
Prerequisite: True Stoneshaping talent
Activation:
Shaping stone with Cohesion has become so natural that
you can mold the ground beneath your feet as you actively
sculpt other stone.
After you use Cohesion or spend at least on one of
its talents, you can shape the stone beneath your feet
without spending additional Investiture to do so. The
stone pushes you up to 5 feet × your ranks in Cohesion,
and you can choose to be pushed in any direction, such
as rising upward on a pillar. This movement doesn’t
trigger Reactive Strikes.
Memories of Stone
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
Your deepening knowledge of the earth allows you to
commune with stone itself, gaining visions of things
the stone has seen.
Spend 1 Investiture to communicate for 1 round with
stone you’re touching. The earth’s knowledge reaches
far, including the area’s history and memories of nearby
events, but it communicates in sculpted images and
faint whispers that might be cryptic or incomplete. To
interpret these communications, the GM might require
you to succeed on a Cohesion test (DC determined by
the GM). To communicate with the stone for more than
1 round, you must use this talent multiple times.
```

**cohesion**

```
Stone Spear
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
Spend 1 Investiture to make
a ranged Cohesion attack vs.
Physical of a target within
60 feet, rolling 2d4 impact
damage.
```

```
Memories of Stone
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
Spend 1 Investiture to
communicate with stone
you’re touching. If this requires
interpretation, test Cohesion
(DC determined by the GM).
```

```
Sinkhole
Spend 1 Investiture and
test Cohesion vs. Cognitive
of chosen targets on stone
ground. On success, the target
sinks into the ground and is
Immobilized.
```

```
Tunneling
Spend 1 Investiture to move
through stone as if through
difficult terrain, leaving a
5-foot tunnel behind you.
```

```
Through the Stone
Use your surges and their
talents as though your reach
is 20 feet.
```

```
True Stoneshaping
Prerequisite: Cohesion 2+
Intricately and extensively
shape stone without using
additional actions or time.
```

```
Unbound Cohesion
Prerequisite: Cohesion 4+
Use Cohesion on any solid
material that isn’t alive,
Invested, or infused with
Stormlight.
```

```
Flowing Earth
After using Cohesion, shape
the stone beneath your
feet, pushing yourself in any
direction up to 5 feet × your
ranks in Cohesion.
```

**218** Chapter 6: Surges

```
Sinkhole
Prerequisite: Stone Spear talent
Activation:
You cause the ground to soften so quickly that it can catch
anyone standing in it by surprise.
Spend 1 Investiture and choose an area of stone ground
of a size you can affect with your ranks in Cohesion.
Then choose one or more characters who are touching
the ground in that area. Make one Cohesion test and
compare the result to the Cognitive defense of each
chosen character. If you succeed against a target,
they sink into the ground and are Immobilized as you
resolidify the rock. (See “Using Cohesion” for rules
on escaping.)
```

```
Stone Spear
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You cause the surface of the stone to launch forward in
tight pillars, solidifying mid-flight before slamming into
your target.
Spend 1 Investiture to make a ranged Cohesion attack
against the Physical defense of a target within 60 feet
of you, rolling 2d4 impact damage. On a hit, you can
also spend to knock the target Prone.
The size of this attack’s damage dice increases with
your ranks in Cohesion; at 2 ranks, roll 2d6 (instead of
2d4), and so on.
Through the Stone
Prerequisite: Sinkhole talent
Activation:
When you touch stone, you can sense and use your
Cohesion through it from a much greater distance.
You can use your surges and their talents as
though your reach is 20 feet, as long as there is a
stone surface between you and your target that
you can touch.
```

```
True Stoneshaping
Prerequisite: Cohesion 2+; Tunneling talent
Activation:
You no longer simply soften stone—you assert your
will on it, molding it into complex shapes with a
mere command.
When you use Cohesion to shape an object or
surface, you can automatically reshape it to your
will without using additional actions or time. For
example, you can instantly raise or lower elevation,
form walls or pillars, create or remove difficult terrain,
or create intricate shapes or images.
```

```
Tunneling
Prerequisite: Sinkhole talent
Activation:
You infuse yourself with Cohesion to shift stone from your
path as you move.
Spend 1 Investiture to infuse yourself with Cohesion.
For the duration, you can move through stone surfaces
and objects as if moving through difficult terrain. You
leave a 5-foot-radius tunnel in your wake through which
others can follow. At the start of each of your turns, you
can spend 1 Investiture as to maintain this infusion.
If you create tunnels near the surface, an observant
character might detect ripples from the diverted
material, potentially sensing your presence.
```

```
Unbound Cohesion
Prerequisite: Cohesion 4+; Through the Stone talent
Activation:
Your Stoneshaping transcends a singular medium, allowing
you to soften and shape nearly any material.
You can use Cohesion and its talents not only on stone,
but on any solid material that isn’t alive, Invested, or
infused with Stormlight.

Division
intellect
The surge of Division allows you to destroy and decay,
causing your target to atrophy, crumble into dust, or fall
apart in other ways.
Division Surge
Radiant Orders: Dustbringer, Skybreaker
Activation:
You can use this surge to decay a character, object, or
area within your reach. You must have a hand free and
touch the target.
Targeting a Character. You can target a character
regardless of their size. Spend 1 Investiture to make a
melee Division attack against the Spiritual defense of
the target, rolling 3d4 spirit damage. If this reduces the
target to 0 health, they crumble into dust and die. The
size of this attack’s damage dice increases with your
ranks in Division; at 2 ranks, roll 3d6 (instead of 3d4),
and so on. As usual, on a hit, add your Division modifier
to damage, and on a miss, you can spend 1 focus to
graze with the attack.
Targeting an Object or Area. To destroy an
object or the contents of an area, spend Investiture
equal to the number of surge ranks required to affect a
target of that size: 1 for Small, 2 for Medium, and so on.
As usual, this object or area can’t exceed the surge size
for your ranks in Division (see the Surge Scaling table
at the beginning of this chapter), even if you have more
Investiture than that.
If you’re in combat or another tense situation, you
must succeed on a Division test (see “Division Under
Pressure” to determine the DC). On a success (or
if you’re not under pressure), your target decays in
a manner of your choosing. For example, you could
crumble the object into dust, etch writing or art into
the object, destroy parts of a object to form a smaller
object, or create a smokescreen that lasts for 1 round
in the destroyed object’s area.
```

```
Smoke curled from the occasional
patches of growth or heaps of burning
corpses. Even some sections of rock
smoldered. The Dustbringers had
done their work well.
```

**220** Chapter 6: Surges

```
JUSTYNA DURA
```

If you attempt elaborate etching or shaping in this
way, it takes additional time and actions. Depending on
complexity, the GM might also require a Division skill
test (or increase the DC for that test).
You can’t use this surge on Invested objects (like
Shardplate) or objects that have been infused with
Stormlight (like infused spheres or objects affected
by surges).

Using Division

In addition to the basic surge rules above, this section
provides more guidance on using or interacting with this
surge in your game.

Division Under Pressure
It requires considerable concentration and accuracy
to use Division while moving, working quickly, or
avoiding threats. While in combat or another tense
situation (like a Mission or Pursuit), you must succeed
on a Division test before destroying an object or area.
The DC for this test is determined by the material
you’re targeting, as shown on the Division Under
Pressure table.
You can’t target materials in this way while they’re in
the body of an unwilling living character; instead, target
the character’s Spiritual defense as described in the
Division surge.

**Division Under Pressure**

```
Material DC
Clear air DC 0
Vapors like smoke and gas DC 5
Liquids like blood, water, and oil DC 10
Organics like flesh, bone, and pulp DC 15
Solids like metal, stone, and crystal DC 20
```

Division Against Others
If a character is willing, you can easily destroy an
object in their possession. However, to destroy an
object held by an unwilling character or to destroy
a portion of a surface that’s supporting most of their
weight (such as the ground they’re standing on or a
wall they’re climbing), you must succeed on a Division
test against either that character’s Physical defense
or the relevant DC on the Division Under Pressure
table, whichever is higher. On a failure, you don’t
destroy that object and you don’t spend Investiture
on the attempt.

```
Division Talents
The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Division talent tree for the Dust-
bringer and Skybreaker paths.

Eroding Escape
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
Spend 1 or more Investiture
to end that many effects
inflicting the Restrained or
Immobilzed condition.
```

```
Igniting Division
When you use Division, spend
1 or more Investiture to light
the target’s space on fire,
dealing ongoing damage equal
to your Division modifier.
```

```
Spark Sending
When there’s a solid surface
between you and target, use
Division as though your reach
is 20 feet.

It costs you one fewer to use
the Division skill. Your Division
Under Pressure DC is reduced
by 5.
```

```
Chapter 6: Surges 221
```

```
Eroding Escape
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
Your ability to decay what you touch ensures you can’t be
contained for long.
Spend 1 Investiture or more to end that many effects on
yourself or an ally within your reach. The chosen effects
must either be applying the Immobilized or Restrained
condition, or be adding a disadvantage to one or more
physical tests.
Depending on the effect’s source, this talent might
not fully destroy the source at the GM’s discretion,
but it creates space or opportunity for your target to
move around it or free themselves from its constraint.
If the effect’s source remains at the end of the target’s
next turn (such as when swimming or when wearing
armor with the Cumbersome trait), the effect then
reasserts itself.
```

```
Gout of Flame
Prerequisite: Igniting Division talent
Activation:
You use Division to spray heat and flame across a
wide area.
Spend 3 Investiture and choose an area up to one size
larger than you can normally affect with your ranks
in Division; if you already have 5 ranks in Division,
you can instead affect an area up to 25 feet in each
dimension.
Make a Division attack against the Physical defense
of each target who is at least partially within the chosen
area, rolling 3d4 energy damage. The size of these
damage dice increases with your ranks in Division;
at 2 ranks, roll 3d6 (instead of 3d4), and so on.
Igniting Division
Prerequisite: Bodily Decay talent
Activation:
You can make anything burn, even materials that are
usually nonflammable.
When you affect a target with Division, you can spend
1 or more additional Investiture to cause that target to
catch fire for a number of rounds equal to the Investiture
spent. If you didn’t already have to make a Division
test when you affected that target (see “Division Under
Pressure”), you must succeed on one now to do so.
For the duration, the target becomes Afflicted,
and the area within 5 feet of the target is lit on fire and
becomes dangerous terrain. Both effects deal energy
damage equal to your Division modifier. At the GM’s
discretion, the dangerous terrain can spread on sub-
sequent rounds.
```

```
The target or a character within reach of it
can Use a Skill to make an Agility or Athletics test
opposed by your Division. If they succeed, the target’s
Afflicted condition ends early, but the ignited area
continues to burn.
Inescapable Spark
Prerequisite: Spark Sending talent
Activation:
You can send your spark to far greater distances, seeking
out targets around corners and through walls and corners.
You can use Division and its talents as though your
reach equals your spren bond range. You still need a
solid surface from you to your target (such as a wall or
floor) along which you can send an entropic spark, but
you don’t need line of effect to your target while you can
sense them.
Additionally, your target can't benefit from the Brace
action against any of your Division attacks.
```

```
Spark Sending
Prerequisite: Bodily Decay talent or Eroding
Escape talent
Activation:
You annihilate your targets from a distance by sending your
entropic spark racing through a physical object, creating a
chain reaction at its destination.
You can use Division and its talents as though your
reach is 20 feet, as long as there is a solid surface from
you to your target (such as a wall or floor) along which
you can send an entropic spark.
Unleashed Entropy
Prerequisite: Spark Sending talent or Gout of
Flame talent
Activation:
You’ve grown so powerful that the ability to destroy
everything around you is almost alarmingly easy.
It costs you one fewer to use Division (but not its
talents). Additionally, your DCs on the Division
Under Pressure table are reduced by 5.

Using Gravitation
In addition to the basic surge rules above, this section
provides more guidance on using or interacting with
this surge in your game.
```

```
Gravitation on Others
Performing a Basic Lashing on an unwilling character
is challenging. To do so, make a Gravitation test against
the target’s Physical defense. On a success, spend
1 Investiture to move the target up to your gravitation
rate in a direction of your choosing.
When you move an unwilling target in this way,
they become Restrained until the start of your next
turn. During this movement, if the target passes within
reach of an object or surface at least one size larger than
them, they can attempt to grab it by using the Avoid
```

```
Gravitation
awareness
The surge of Gravitation can change the direction
and magnitude of an object’s gravitational attraction.
Gravitation infusions temporarily draw an object to
another point instead of the planet’s center of gravity.
This is known as a Basic Lashing.
Gravitation Surge
Radiant Orders: Skybreaker, Windrunner
Activation:
To perform a Basic Lashing, spend 1 Investiture or more
to infuse a character or object within your reach; you
must have a hand free and touch the target. Your target
can’t exceed the surge size for your ranks in Gravitation
(see the Surge Scaling table at the beginning of
this chapter).
The infusion uses 1 Investiture each round, and
for the duration, the target’s gravity changes directions
(as described below in “Targeting a Character” and
“Targeting an Object”). This change uses your
gravitation rate, which begins at 25 feet.
Your target doesn’t move fast enough to deal damage
on impact. However, if a target is aloft when the surge
ends, they fall and take the usual damage from the fall
(see “Movement and Positioning” in chapter 10).
Targeting a Character. You can target a willing
character, granting them a flying rate equal to your
gravitation rate for the duration. (For rules on flying,
see “Movement and Positioning” in chapter 10.)
Alternatively, you can infuse yourself with Gravitation
regardless of your size, gaining the same flying rate and
spending 1 Investiture each round to maintain the surge.
To target an unwilling character, see “Gravitation
on Others.”
Targeting an Object. You can target an object,
declaring a new direction for its gravity. At the start of
each of your turns, after the infusion expends another
1 Investiture, move that object in a straight line up to
your gravitation rate.
You can’t use this surge on Invested objects (like
Shardplate) or objects that have been infused with
Stormlight (like infused spheres or objects affected
by surges).

Danger reaction to make an Agility test opposed by your
Gravitation (their Restrained condition doesn’t impose
a disadvantage on this test). If your target succeeds, they
stop moving; while they continue holding on, you can’t
move them further with this infusion.
Tricky Maneuvers
When flying or moving something with a Basic Lashing,
you don’t usually need to make a test. However, if you’re
attempting something particularly dangerous or tricky—
such as flying through a highstorm or threading an
object through a small gap—you must succeed on a
Gravitation test to perform the Lashing (DC set at
the GM’s discretion).

readying them to fly together at a moment’s notice.
You can use your Group Flight in combat.
Flying Ace
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You are a master of the skies, adeptly wielding your weapon
while in flight.
While maintaining a Basic Lashing on yourself, fly
a distance up to your gravitation rate. Once during
this movement, you can spend 1 focus to make a
melee weapon attack as part of the same action. After
resolving that attack, you can continue your movement.
Additionally, when you acquire this talent, your
gravitation rate increases to 40 feet.

Gravitational Slam
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
Your Basic Lashings become more forceful and potentially
dangerous on impact.
When you use a Basic Lashing to move an unwilling
creature or object into a solid surface, the collision
stops that movement early, and you can choose for the
Lashed target to take 1d4 impact damage for every
10 feet they were moved with that Lashing on this

turn. For example, if you moved them 25 feet then
they collide with a wall, they take 2d4 impact damage.
Your target can use the Avoid Danger reaction to
make an Agility test opposed by your Gravitation,
taking half as much damage on a success.
The size of these damage dice increases with your
ranks in Gravitation; at 2 ranks, roll 1d6 (instead of
1d4), and so on.
Group Flight
Prerequisite: Stable Flight talent
Activation:
You can infuse multiple allies with Gravitation at once.
While not in combat, when you spend 1 Investiture
or more to infuse yourself or a willing character
with a Basic Lashing, you can also infuse a number
of additional willing characters up to your ranks in
Gravitation. Each target must be within your reach.
These infusions last for the duration of the original
infusion and require no additional Investiture to
create or maintain.

```
Lashing Shot
Prerequisite: Gravitational Slam talent
Activation:
You apply multiple Basic Lashings to an object, launching
it with several times the force of gravity.
You touch an unattended object of a size you can
affect with your ranks in Gravitation, then you propel
that object at a target in your line of effect, spending
Investiture equal to the distance to that target divided
by your gravitation rate (rounded up).
Make a ranged Gravitation attack against the
Physical defense of that target, rolling 2d4 impact
damage. The size of these damage dice increases with
your ranks in Gravitation; at 2 ranks, roll 2d6 (instead
of 2d4), and so on.
Master of the Skies
Prerequisite: Group Flight talent or Lashing
Shot talent
Activation:
You’ve become so efficient at infusing yourself with
Gravitation that it becomes subconscious, allowing you
to endlessly soar.
While you have 1 Investiture or more, you gain the
benefits of being infused with Gravitation without
spending Investiture.

```
Multiple Lashings
Prerequisite: Gravitational Slam talent
Activation:
You can apply multiple Basic Lashings to an enemy.
After you succeed on a Gravitation test to move an
unwilling character, you can infuse them with an
amount of Investiture up to your ranks in Gravitation
(instead of only 1 Investiture). When you do, the effect
continues until the infusion ends (instead of until the
start of your next turn).
```

```
Stable Flight
Prerequisite: Flying Ace talent
Activation:
You’re an expert in launching attacks from afar in
mid-flight.

Illumination
presence
The surge of Illumination can create convincing
illusions, both visual and auditory. This ability
is commonly known as Lightweaving , though
Lightweavers and Truthwatchers can both use
this surge.
Illumination Surge
Radiant Orders: Lightweaver, Truthwatcher
Activation:
To Lightweave an illusion, spend 1 Investiture or more
to infuse it into thin air in a space within your spren
bond range. This illusion can’t exceed the surge size
for your ranks in Illumination (see the Surge Scaling
table at the beginning of this chapter).
Lightweavings typically take the form of a three-
dimensional hologram representing a character, object,
or phenomenon you’re familiar with. This illusion
is composed of light, complete with animation and
accompanying sounds produced by the vibrations of
your bonded spren.
Simple and Complex Illusions. If the illusion
depicts a simple object with no sound or animations,
the infusion uses 1 Investiture every 10 minutes. If the
illusion depicts a character or more complex object, it
instead uses 1 Investiture each round. For the duration,
the illusion remains active even if you move out of range.
You can move and control a complex illusion, as detailed
in “Controlling Illusions.”
Disguising Yourself. Alternatively, if you have
1 Investiture or more, you can use Illumination to
create an illusory disguise on yourself without spending
Investiture. This disguise lasts until you end it as or
run out of Investiture.
Deceiving Characters. If your illusion is a
simple object or a disguise on yourself, it automatically
convinces characters unless they have a reason to
be suspicious. If you create a more complex illusion
(such as disguising another character), the GM might
require you to make an Illumination test against the
Cognitive defense of any character who passively
observes the illusion; on a success, your illusion is
convincing to them.
```

```
A character might decide to Use a Skill to scrutinize
your illusion, especially if you fail the above Illumination
test or if you or your allies roll a Complication on a
related test. In this case, make an Illumination test
opposed by the character’s Perception test. If their test
result exceeds your own, they notice the illusion (see
“Detecting Illusions” for the effects).
You can make these tests to deceive characters even if
that illusion is currently out of your spren bond range.
```

```
Using Illumination
In addition to the basic surge rules above, this section
provides more guidance on using or interacting with this
surge in your game.
Imagining Illusions
Lightweaving is easiest when replicating something
you’re familiar with. If you have a great memory or if
you reference material you created (such as a sketch,
a painting, or a written passage) you might be able to
Lightweave something you’ve only encountered a few
times—but your Illumination tests to deceive onlookers
will probably gain a disadvantage.
It’s very challenging to Lightweave something you’ve
only seen in drawings or imagined yourself. It’s up
to your GM how difficult this is, but you might face
challenges such as a reduced surge size, an additional
Investiture cost, a focus cost, an increased DC, or a
disadvantage on your d20 roll.
```

```
Controlling Illusions
You can control all of your complex illusions that are
within your spren bond range. Each illusion can pretend
to interact with its environment; for example, you might
make an illusionary tree bend with the wind, or make
an illusionary child try to catch a ball (but intentionally
miss it). However, your illusion has no senses of its
own, so you can’t give it tasks that require senses or
knowledge you don’t have.
An illusion can move up to your movement rate
on your turn in a manner reasonable for that illusion.
You can use to have one or more of your illusions
perform simple, mindless tasks like walking across the
street or shouting a phrase. You can use to task one
of your illusions with something that requires your
careful attention, such as convincingly conversing
with someone.
If you move out of range, your illusions can only
perform whatever simple, mindless tasks you last gave
them, such as gazing thoughtfully at a bookshelf.
```

**226** Chapter 6: Surges

```
Maintaining Illusions
When your illusions begin running out of Stormlight,
you can seamlessly maintain them by feeding Invest-
iture from your own supply. You can use to infuse
1 Investiture or more into any illusions of your choice
within your spren bond range (spending separate
Investiture for each illusion).
```

```
Detecting Illusions
A failed Illumination test or an unfortunate
Complication can cause a target to recognize that an
illusion is artificial. However, when this happens, the
illusion itself persists, and it might even continue to
conceal something else in the right circumstances.
For example, if you Lightweave a boulder around
yourself, a successful Perception test may alert an
enemy that something is amiss, but they still won’t
be able to see inside the boulder. (However, you can’t
see through your illusionary boulder either!)
Tests aren’t the only way to detect an illusion (or to
become suspicious of one). If one character detects an
illusion, they might alert their allies that it isn’t real.
And if a physical object passes through an illusion, a
white blur appears at the intersection, and a character
familiar with Lightweaving might recognize these
telltale signs. Such events can betray the presence of
Lightweaving, and any character wishing to determine
the boundaries or source of an illusion can make
a Deduction or Perception test opposed by your
Illumination.

Illumination Talents
The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Illumination talent tree for the
Lightweaver and Truthwatcher paths.
Disorienting Flash
Prerequisite: Distracting Illusion talent
Activation:
```

_You create a brief burst of light and sound that attacks
the senses of targets near you._
Spend 1 Investiture to project a burst of light in an area
within your reach, up to the size you can create with
your ranks in Illumination. Make one Illumination test
and compare the result against the Cognitive defense
of each character in that area. If you succeed against
a target, they become Disoriented until the end of
their next turn.

```
Distracting Illusion
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You create a moving, illusory copy of someone to distract
your enemies.
Spend 1 Investiture to Lightweave an illusory duplicate,
either of yourself or an ally you can sense within
your spren bond range. The illusion appears in that
character’s space and moves with them. Attacks against
that character gain a disadvantage and can’t graze.
The illusion ends after an attack misses that character
or at the end of the scene.
```

**illumination**

```
Distracting Illusion
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
Spend 1 Investiture to Light-
weave an illusion of yourself or
an ally. Until an attack misses
the target, attacks against
them gain a disadvantage and
can’t graze.
```

```
Lingering
Lightweavings
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
You can infuse an illusion in
a sphere. The illusion moves
with the sphere, expending
1 Investiture per rounds equal
to your ranks in Illumination.
```

```
Disorienting Flash
Spend 1 Investiture to
project light in an area, testing
Illumination vs. Cognitive of
each character to make them
Disoriented.
```

```
Stormlight
Reclamation
End Illumination infusions
within spren bond range
and recover their remaining
Investiture.
```

```
Spiritual Illumination
Spend 2 Investiture to cause
an ally to become Determined
and Focused.
```

```
Multiplicative
Lightweaving
You can Lightweave additional
illusions, up to your ranks
in Illumination, with no
additional Investiture.
```

```
Painful Truth
Spend 2 Investiture and test
Illumination vs. Spiritual of a
target. On success, they are
Slowed and must Move away
on their next turn or spend
focus to avoid doing so.
```

```
Endless Illusions
You can maintain illusions
indefinitely. While you have
Investiture, Illumination infu-
sions in your spren bond range
don’t expend Investiture.
```

```
Chapter 6: Surges 227
```

```
Spiritual Illumination
Prerequisite: Disorienting Flash talent
Activation:
You use Lightweaving to show your allies inspiring
possibilities of who they could become.
Spend 2 Investiture to create a momentary Light-
weaving near an ally you can sense within your spren
bond range. That ally becomes Determined and
Focused until the end of their next turn.
Stormlight Reclamation
Prerequisite: Distracting Illusion talent
Activation:
You can reclaim Stormlight from active illusions.
After your infusions expend their infused
Investiture at the start of your turn, you can end
any number of those infusions within your reach,
recovering all remaining Investiture they were
infused with.
```

```
Endless Illusions
Prerequisite: Multiplicative Lightweaving talent or
Spiritual Illumination talent
Activation:
You’ve become so efficient at powering your illusions
that you can maintain them indefinitely.
While you have 1 Investiture or more, each of your
Illumination infusions within your spren bond range
expends no infused Investiture at the start of your turn.
```

```
Lingering Lightweaving
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You infuse spheres with your Illumination, creating
illusions that linger long after you’ve moved away.
When you Lightweave an illusion, instead of creating
it in thin air, you can instead infuse its Investiture in a
sphere or unencased gem within 5 feet of that illusion.
For the duration, the illusion moves with the gem; for
example, an ally could carry this gem to extend the
duration of an illusory disguise you created for them.
Instead of the infusion expending 1 Investiture per
round, it expends 1 Investiture per number of rounds
equal to your ranks in Illumination; for example, if you
have 3 ranks in Illumination, your infusions in spheres
expend Investiture once every 3 rounds.
Multiplicative Lightweaving
Prerequisite: Stormlight Reclamation talent
Activation:
You effortlessly Lightweave multiple illusions at once.
When you Lightweave an illusion, you can create a
number of additional illusions up to your ranks in
Illumination. These infusions last for the duration
of the original infusion and require no additional
Investiture to create or maintain.
```

```
Painful Truth
Prerequisite: Spiritual Illumination talent
Activation:
You create a haunting image of who an enemy could
have been if they’d taken a better path.
Spend 2 Investiture and make an Illumination test
against the Spiritual defense of a target you can
sense within your spren bond range. On a success,
they stumble in shock, becoming Slowed until the
end of their next turn.
At the start of the target’s next turn, they must either
spend focus equal to your ranks in Illumination to end
this effect as , or immediately use the Move action to
move as far as possible away from you.

Progression
awareness
```

The surge of Progression controls the growth and
healing of living things. Its two primary effects are
**Growth** (which can rapidly sprout and mature plants)
and **Regrowth** (which can heal a character’s body
and soul).

Progression Surge
**Radiant Orders:** Edgedancer, Truthwatcher
**Activation:**

You infuse life into a living thing other than yourself
within your reach; you must have a hand free and
touch the target.
**Plant Growth.** If you target a living plant (or its
seed) with Growth, spend 1 Investiture to cause it to
rapidly grow to a size of your choice. This can’t exceed
the surge size for your ranks in Progression (see the
Surge Scaling table at the beginning of this chapter),
nor the normal limits of the largest plants of its species.
**Character Regrowth.** If you target a living
character with Regrowth, infuse 1 Investiture or more
into them. The infusion uses 1 Investiture each round,
and for the duration, that character recovers health
equal to 1d4 + your Progression modifier at the start
of each of their turns. The size of this die increases with
your ranks in Progression: at 2 ranks, roll 1d6 when
recovering health (instead of 1d4), and so on.

Using Progression

In addition to the basic surge rules above, this section
provides more guidance on using or interacting with
this surge in your game.

Growth
Growth can be used creatively in many ways. You might
grow a pathway over an obstacle or create inconspicuous
concealment. You could block line of effect, create cover
or difficult terrain, or erect obstacles to climb. It’s up to
you and your GM to resolve such creative uses.

```
Regrowth
Regrowth heals by transforming the target’s Physical
form to better match their Cognitive and Spiritual self.
As such, the narrative effect of each character’s healing
depends on who they are at their core and how they view
themself. When you use Progression to heal a character,
they (not you) determine what’s healed and how, likely
doing so subconsciously.
```

**progression**

```
Injury Regrowth
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
Spend 2 Investiture to cause
a target to recover from a
temporary injury, or spend
3 Investiture to recover from
a permanent one.
```

```
Explosive Growth
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
Spend 1 Investiture to explo-
sively grow plants in an area.
Make a Progression attack
vs. Physical of each character
of your choice, rolling 2d4
impact or keen damage.
```

```
Swift Regeneration
Prerequisite: Progression 2+
When you Regenerate, recover
health equal to 1d6 + your
Progression modifier. While
you have Investiture, you and
your Regrowth targets can add
your Progression modifier to
injury rolls.
```

```
Overgrowth
When you infuse Growth into a
plant, test Progression (DC 15)
to cause it to grow much larger
and stronger than its species’
normal limits.
```

```
Extended Regrowth
Your Regrowth infusions
only expend 1 Investiture per
rounds equal to your ranks in
Progression.
```

```
Reliable Progression
Prerequisite: Progression 2+
When you roll a Progression
die, make the result equal your
ranks in Progression.
```

```

Prerequisite: Progression 3+
Spend 3 Investiture to restore
life to a willing character who
died within the last minute.
```

```
Font of Life

```

```
Chapter 6: Surges 229
```

```
Injury Regrowth
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You use Regrowth to rapidly recover injuries, including
permanent ones and missing body parts.
Spend 2 Investiture to cause yourself or a willing
character you touch to instantly recover from a
temporary injury of the target’s choice, or spend
3 Investiture to recover from a permanent injury.
```

```
Overgrowth
Prerequisite: Explosive Growth talent
Activation:
You persuade plants to grow beyond their normal size
and shape.
When you infuse Growth into a plant, you can make
a DC 15 Progression test as part of that action. On a
success, you cause the plant to grow beyond its species’
normal limits, up to the surge size for your ranks in
Progression, and the plant’s current and total health
increase by 2d4. The size of these dice increases with
your ranks in Progression; at 2 ranks, roll 2d6 (instead
of 2d4), and so on.
Reliable Progression
Prerequisite: Progression 2+; Overgrowth talent
Activation:
Through adept control of your Stormlight, your Growth
and Regrowth become even more dependable.
When you roll a die whose size increases with your
ranks in Progression (such as when using the Explosive
Growth, Overgrowth, and Swift Regeneration talents)
or when a willing character rolls a die to recover health
from your Regrowth, if the die rolls a number lower than
your ranks in Progression, you can change that result
to instead equal your ranks in Progression (no action
required).
```

```
Swift Regeneration
Prerequisite: Progression 2+; Injury Regrowth talent
Activation:
You can heal yourself with greater efficiency and make
those infused with your Regrowth more resistant to injury.
When you use Regenerate, instead of recovering the
normal amount of health, you can recover health equal
to 1d6 + your Progression modifier. The size of this die
increases with your ranks in Progression: at 3 ranks,
roll 1d8 (instead of 1d6), and so on.
Additionally, while you have 1 Investiture or more,
you and any character infused with your Regrowth can
add your Progression modifier to injury rolls.
```

```
Progression Talents
The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Progression talent tree for the
Edgedancer and Truthwatcher paths.
```

```
Explosive Growth
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You grow plants explosively, striking and ensnaring
your enemies.
Spend 1 Investiture to use Growth in an area up to the
size you can affect with your ranks in Progression. Make
one Progression attack and compare the test result to
the Physical defense of each character of your choice
in that area. Roll 2d4 damage, dealing either impact or
keen damage (whichever is logical for the grown plants).
The size of this attack’s damage dice increases with your
ranks in Progression; at 2 ranks, roll 2d6 (instead of
2d4), and so on.
You can spend to cause any number of the targets
you hit to become Immobilized until the end of your
next turn.
Extended Regrowth
Prerequisite: Swift Regeneration talent
Activation:
Your Regrowth infusions expend Stormlight far less quickly.
When you infuse Regrowth into a character, instead
of the infusion expending 1 Investiture per round,
it expends 1 Investiture per number of rounds equal
to your ranks in Progression. For example, if you
have 3 ranks in Progression, those infusions expend
Investiture once every 3 rounds.
```

```
Font of Life
Prerequisite: Extended Regrowth talent or Reliable
Progression talent
Activation:
You’ve grown so powerful that growth and healing flow
from you with incredible speed.
It costs you one fewer to use Progression and
its talents.
From the Brink
Prerequisite: Progression 3+; Extended
Regrowth talent
Activation:
You use Regrowth to pull someone back from the very
edge of death.
Spend 3 Investiture and touch the body of a character
who died within the last minute. If the target is willing,
they return to life Unconscious with 0 health.

**230** Chapter 6: Surges

```
Tension
strength
The surge of Tension alters the rigidity of objects.
This allows you to reinforce flexible materials such as
cloth, making them firm and strong like steel.
Tension Surge
Radiant Orders: Bondsmith, Stoneward
Activation:
To use this surge, spend 1 or more Investiture to
infuse a soft object within your reach; you must have
a hand free and touch the target. The infusion uses
1 Investiture each round, and for the duration, the
object becomes completely rigid.
This object can’t exceed the surge size for your ranks
in Tension (see the Surge Scaling table at the beginning
of this chapter).
When you activate this surge, you can first form the
soft material into a rough shape as part of that action,
but any elaborate molding requires more time (see
“Creating Objects and Weapons”).
You can’t use this surge on characters, Invested
objects (like Shardplate), or objects that have been
infused with Stormlight (like infused spheres or objects
affected by surges).
Hardened Defense. When you infuse a soft mate-
rial worn by you or a willing character, you can increase
the wearer’s Physical defense by 2. Alternatively,
before you infuse a material, you can wrap it around a
character as part of that action, granting the same effect.
A character’s Physical defense can’t benefit from more
than one Tension surge at a time.
```

```
Using Tension
In addition to the basic surge rules above, this section
provides more guidance on using or interacting with this
surge in your game.
```

```
Creating Objects and Weapons
You can shape cloth, rope, or other soft materials into
a specific form, then infuse Tension to temporarily
stiffen them into a usable object. When you activate
the surge, you can briefly shape the material, but more
elaborate reshaping requires additional time. In combat,
this usually requires an additional Interact action
```

(for moderate reshaping) or Use a Skill action (if
your creation is intricate enough to require a Tension
skill test). The GM sets this test’s DC based on the
complexity of the object you’re creating.
At the GM’s discretion, you can creatively use
Tension to create nearly any solid object of an
appropriate size. For example, you might shape a
tarp into a box, then infuse it to use as a stepping
stool. You could shove a handkerchief into a keyhole,
then infuse it to make a key that can open the lock.
A piece of rope could even serve as a sturdy staff or
similar weapon.
When using Tension to temporarily create a weapon,
treat it as an improvised non-special weapon, but
remove its Fragile trait (see “Improvised Weapons”
in chapter 7).

Chapter 6: Surges 231
```

```
Tension on Opponents
While it’s simple to shape unattended cloth, it’s
challenging to wrap your opponent in it or to infuse
something they’re already wearing. To infuse an object
worn by or wrapped around an unwilling target, make a
Tension test against the target’s Physical defense. On a
failure, you don’t infuse that object and you don’t spend
Investiture on the attempt. On a success, the target has
difficulty moving for the duration, becoming Slowed
and gaining a disadvantage on all physical tests.
A character can try to bend an object you’ve stiffened
with your Tension. To do so, they Use a Skill to make an
Athletics test opposed by your Tension. If they succeed,
the infusion ends.
```

```
Tension Talents
The following talents, presented here in alphabet-
ical order, appear in the Tension talent tree for the
Stoneward path.
```

```
Cloth Mastery
Prerequisite: Tension 2+; Rigged Weaponry talent
Activation:
As you infuse soft materials with Tension, they contort
themselves into exactly what you envision.
When you use Tension to create an object or weapon,
you can automatically reshape it before it becomes rigid
without using additional actions or time. When you
do, you instantaneously mold the soft material into an
object as elaborate, intricate, and complex as you wish.
For example, you could turn a large tarp into a table or
chair, shape a cloak around its wearer as a functioning
suit of half plate, cause a grappling hook attached to a
rope to secure itself to a ledge above, or create intricate
shapes or images.
Clothsmith
Prerequisite: Cloth Mastery talent or Surface
Tension talent
Activation:
The impromptu weapons and armor you create with Tension
are so powerful that they rival Shardblades and Plate.
When you infuse Tension to grant a character the
Hardened Defense effect, their Physical defense
increases by 4 (instead of 2).
Additionally, when you temporarily create a weapon
with Tension (see “Creating Objects and Weapons”),
it gains an extra d4 damage die (for example, an axe
created this way deals 1d6 + 1d4 keen damage). The
size of this die increases with your ranks in Tension;
at 2 ranks, the extra die becomes a d6 (instead of a
d4), and so on.

or 2 focus to infuse Tension
into an object the target is
holding.
```

```
Extended Tension
Your Tension infusions only
expend 1 Investiture per
rounds equal to your ranks
in Tension. While you have
Investiture, you can freely
maintain Tension infusions
on objects you’re holding.

Cloth Mastery
Prerequisite: Tension 2+
Use Tension to instantly create
intricate and complex objects.
```

```
Surface Tension
Use Tension to increase a
liquid’s surface tension and
walk on it like solid ground.
```

```
Fine Control
Spend Investiture to infuse an
object you can control with
while touching it. It can move
up to 25 feet along surfaces,
perform tasks, and make
attacks using your Tension.
```

```
Clothsmith
Your Hardened Defense effect
increases the target’s Physical
defense by 4 instead of 2.
When you temporarily create a
weapon with Tension, it gains
an extra d4 damage die.
```

**232** Chapter 6: Surges

```
Extended Tension
Prerequisite: Stormlight Reclamation talent
Activation:
```

_Your infusions of Tension expend the Stormlight far
less quickly._
When you infuse Tension into an object, instead of the
infusion expending 1 Investiture per round, it expends
1 Investiture per number of rounds equal to your ranks
in Tension. For example, if you have 3 ranks in Tension,
those infusions expend Investiture once every 3 rounds.
Additionally, while you have 1 Investiture or more,
you can maintain Tension infusions on objects you’re
holding or wearing without either you or the infusion
expending Investiture.

```
Fine Control
Prerequisite: Cloth Mastery talent
Activation:
```

_Your careful practice allows you to selectively change the
rigidity of an object’s parts, allowing fine control much like
the movement of muscles and tendons._
Infuse 1 Investiture or more into an unattended object
within reach that is of a size you can affect with Tension.
Though the infused object isn’t a character, for the
duration, its current and maximum health both increase
to 5 × your ranks in Tension, and each of its defenses
equals 10 + your Tension modifier. If the infused object
is reduced to 0 health, the infusion ends early and the
object breaks.
Many Tension users infuse long pieces of cloth,
rope, or other flexible material that they can control,
effectively extending their range. On each of your turns
for the duration, while touching part of one object you
infused using this talent, you can move it up to 25 feet
along surfaces (including ceilings) and can use it to
interact with characters and other objects. You can use
to have one infused object perform simple tasks like
climbing a tree or opening a door. You can use to task
one infused object with something that requires a test
or your careful attention, such as attacking someone or
writing a message. The object has no senses of its own
and can’t act without your touch and direct control, so
you can’t give it tasks that require senses or knowledge
you don’t have.
If the object’s task requires a test (such as an attack or
Athletics test), you must be able to sense its target, and
you use your Tension instead of that test’s usual skill.
The object can make a melee attack using Tension
against the Physical defense of a target within 5 feet of
it, rolling 2d4 impact damage. The size of these dice
increases with your ranks in Tension; at 2 ranks, roll
2d6 (instead of 2d4), and so on.

```
Rigged Weaponry
Prerequisite: Tension Parry talent
Activation:
Dynamic use of Tension on cloth or rope allows you to
augment your martial prowess.
While wielding a melee weapon and holding cloth or
other flexible object that’s at least 10 feet long, you can
spend 1 Investiture as to increase the weapon’s reach
by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.
Additionally, after you hit a character with a melee
attack, you can spend or 2 focus to use Tension on
an object the target is holding or wearing, infusing
Investiture as usual but without spending an action.
You automatically succeed on the test to infuse it.
```

```
Stormlight Reclamation
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You can reclaim Stormlight from active infusions.
After your infusions expend their infused Investiture at
the start of your turn, you can end any number of those
infusions within your reach, recovering all remaining
Investiture they were infused with.
Surface Tension
Prerequisite: Extended Tension talent
Activation:
You use Tension to solidify the surface of liquids into
traversable ground.
You can use Tension on liquid, affecting an area up
to twice the size you can normally affect with your
ranks in Tension. For the duration, this liquid’s surface
tension increases and characters can walk on it like
solid ground.
```

```
Tension Parry
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You stiffen clothing to block incoming attacks.
Before you or an ally within your reach is hit or grazed
by an attack against Physical defense, you can use this
reaction to infuse Tension into the target’s clothing or
a soft material you wrap around the target, spending
Investiture as usual. They gain the Hardened Defense
effect, increasing their Physical defense by 2 for the
duration, including against the triggering attack. If the
attack hit, this increase can change it to a miss. If the
attack grazed, the target ignores its effects.
```

```
Chapter 6: Surges 233
```

```
Determine which category best corresponds to your
original material, then choose what category you want
to transform the material into. If you’re transforming
it into a material no more than one category away,
make a DC 10 Transformation test. This DC increases
by 5 for each additional category away, as shown
on the Transformation Difficulty Classes table; to
use that table, find the cell that intersects with both
your original material and your target material. For
example, Soulcasting stone into metal is significantly
easier (DC 10) than Soulcasting to create metal out
of thin air (DC 25).
Successful Transformation. On a successful
Transformation test, you compel the material to
transform. Spend Investiture equal to the ranks required
to transform an object of that size: 1 Investiture
for a Small object, 2 Investiture for a Medium one,
3 Investiture for a Large one, 4 Investiture for a Huge
one, and 5 Invest iture for a Gargantuan one. Your target
transforms into that substance.
Failed Transformation. On a failure, you don’t
transform your target and you don’t spend Investiture
on the attempt. Since you’ve failed to compel that
material to transform, you can’t attempt to Soulcast
that same object again during this scene.

Transformation
willpower
The surge of Transformation transforms one material
into another. Often called Soulcasting , this surge shifts
your perception of the object you want to transform,
allowing you to see and communicate with its Cogni-
tive aspect.
Transformation Surge
Radiant Orders: Elsecaller, Lightweaver
Activation:
To Soulcast a material, choose a non-living object or
portion of a surface within your reach and make a
Transformation test (see “Transformation DC” below).
To do so, you must have a hand free and touch the
target. This target can’t exceed the surge size for your
ranks in Transformation.
You can’t use this surge on Invested objects (like
Shardplate) or objects that have been infused with
Stormlight (like infused spheres or objects affected by
surges). Additionally, you can’t initially Soulcast living
materials, including characters and plants (though
talents can allow you to do so).
Transformation DC. Soulcasting one material
into a similar one is relatively simple, but the more you
change its Essence, the more skill is required. Each
material falls into one of six categories:
```

**1.** Solids like metal, stone, and crystal
**2.** Organic matter like flesh, bone, and pulp
**3.** Liquids like blood, water, and oil
**4.** Vapors like smoke and gas
**5.** Clear air
**6.** Flame (only available
to characters with the
Flamecasting talent)

```
Transformation on Others
While you can’t Soulcast living characters with the
basic Transformation surge, you can creatively use
your abilities to be useful and dangerous in combat.
You might create obscuring fog out of thin air, giving
attackers a disadvantage. You could create cover
to shield behind. You might even turn the ground
beneath your opponent’s feet into liquid, causing
them to fall Prone.
It’s up to you and your GM to resolve such
creative uses. In general, if your Soulcasting requires
the opponent to make a test (such as to stay on their
feet), their DC is equal to your Transformation
test result.

Transformation Talents
The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Transformation talent tree for the
Elsecaller and Lightweaver paths.
Bloodcasting
Prerequisite: Living Soulcasting talent
Activation:
```

_You’ve practiced techniques for Soulcasting blood, allowing
you to cleanse the body of poison and to speed recovery
from injuries._
While touching a character, spend 1 Investiture and
make a DC 15 Transformation test to cleanse their
blood. On a success, the effects of any poison end for
the target, and you can reduce the recovery time of one
of their injuries by 5 days.
The GM can spend from this test to reduce the
target’s maximum health by twice their level until after
the target’s next long rest.

```
Peering Into Shadesmar
The surge of Transformation grants a limited ability to look
into the Cognitive Realm. To do so, you can spend 2 Inves-
titure and Use a Skill to make a Transformation test. On a
success, you can use one effect from the Transportation
surge (see “Transportation”) to perceive 10 feet around
you in the corresponding location in Shadesmar.

Transformation (DC 15) to
cleanse all poison from the
target and reduce one injury’s
recovery time by 5 days.
```

```
Distant
Surgebinding
Use your surges and their
talents as though your reach
is 20 feet.
```

```
Flamecasting
You gain “Flame” as a sixth
category following “Clear Air”
(DC 30 to transform stone
to flame). When Soulcasting
flames, attack each character
within 5 feet using Transform-
ation vs. Physical, rolling 2d4
energy damage.
```

```
Persistent
Transformation
Prerequisite: Transformation 2+
When transforming non-living
objects, your max DC is 15.
Also, you can reattempt Soul-
casting, but on success, must
spend 1 additional Investiture
per recent Soulcasting failure.
```

```
Expansive
Transmuter
Soulcasting non-living material
costs 2 fewer Investiture.
```

```
Chapter 6: Surges 235
```

```
Distant Surgebinding
Prerequisite: Soulcast Parry talent
Activation:
You can Soulcast from a greater distance.
You can use your surges and their talents as though your
reach is 20 feet, and you don’t need to touch the target.
```

```
Expansive Transmuter
Prerequisite: Flamecasting talent
Activation:
You’ve become so powerful that you can Soulcast larger
objects with much greater efficiency.
When you Soulcast non-living material, reduce the
Investiture cost by 2 (to a minimum of 1 Investiture).
For example, it now costs you only 1 Investiture to
Soulcast either a Small, Medium, or Large object.
Flamecasting
Prerequisite: Soulcast Parry talent
Activation:
You’ve learned the difficult art of Soulcasting Essences
directly into instantaneous bursts of flame.
On your surge’s list of Soulcasting materials, you gain
a sixth category called “Flame,” which follows the entry
for “Clear Air.” When Soulcasting a material that’s five
spaces away on this expanded list, the DC is 30 (such
as when Soulcasting stone into flame).
When you Soulcast an object into flame, the flames
last for only a moment before dissipating. However,
before they do, they can catch flammable objects on fire.
Additionally, when you Soulcast an object into flame,
use the result of that Transformation test to make an
attack as against the Physical defense of each character
within 5 feet of the Soulcast object. Roll 2d4 energy
damage. The size of these damage dice increases with
your ranks in Transformation; at 2 ranks, roll 2d6
(instead of 2d4), and so on.
```

```
Living Soulcasting
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You’ve mastered the subtleties of affecting living flesh with
Soulcasting.
Spend 1 Investiture and make a melee Transformation
attack against the Spiritual defense of a character,
plant, or other living organism within your reach.
Roll 3d4 spirit damage. The size of these damage dice
increases with your ranks in Transformation; at 2 ranks,
roll 3d6 (instead of 3d4), and so on.
If this reduces the target to 0 health, they die, and
you transform their body into your choice of material
without spending additional actions or Investiture.
```

```
Persistent Transformation
Prerequisite: Transformation 2+; Distant Surge-
binding talent
Activation:
Your force of will is so great that objects have a hard time
denying you.
When transforming a non-living material, your Trans-
formation test has a maximum DC of 15.
Additionally, after you fail to Soulcast an object, you
can attempt to do so again during the same scene. When
you succeed on this test, you must spend 1 additional
Investiture per time you failed to Soulcast that object
during this scene; if you can’t spend that much Invest-
iture, the object isn’t transformed.
```

```
Soulcast Defense
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You Soulcast near-instinctively, able to transform projectiles
in flight.
Before you or an ally within your reach is hit by a pro-
jectile from a ranged attack, you can use this reaction
and spend 1 Investiture to make a Transformation test.
The DC of this test equals the triggering attack’s test
result; you can choose whether to use this reaction after
you learn the DC.
On a failure, the attack grazes instead of hitting.
On a success, the attack instead misses and can’t graze,
and you transform the projectile into a material of your
choice. If you choose a non-solid material, this destroys
the projectile.
Soulcast Parry
Prerequisite: Soulcast Defense talent
Activation:
You can use Soulcasting to defend against even more
immediate threats.
You can now use Soulcast Defense on melee weapon
attacks as well as ranged ones.

Transportation
intellect
```

The surge of Transportation allows you to transition
yourself and others between the different realms.
However, mastering it takes great skill, and at first,
you’ll only be able to peer into the Cognitive Realm
(also known as Shadesmar).

Transportation Surge
**Radiant Orders:** Elsecaller, Willshaper
**Activation:**

Spend 1 Investiture or more to look into the Cognitive
Realm where it corresponds to your current location.
This allows you to see the true nature of many things
around you. For each Investiture you spend, you can
use one of these effects within your spren bond range:

**Learn Emotions and Motives.** You can observe
what types of spren gather around people, helping
you discern their true emotions or motives. This
might grant you one or more advantages on a test
to influence them, or you might learn their motive
without an Insight test.
**Locate Characters.** By watching the flames of other
people and learning how to identify them, you can
make a guess at their location in the Physical Realm
(if they’re close enough for you to spot their flame in
Shadesmar).
**Sense Investiture.** Objects and people Invested with
Stormlight or other Investiture can be seen in the
Cognitive Realm, revealing their true nature. This
might be a Fused, another Radiant, or an object like
a Shardblade or a fabrial.

Spotting and identifying some of these things can be
difficult, and at the GM’s discretion, you might need
to succeed on a Transportation test to do so.

**transportation**

```
Cognitive Farsight
Prerequisite: Speak the
First Ideal
You can spot things in the Cog-
nitive Realm up to a distance
equal to 3 × your spren
bond range. While you have
Investiture, you can identify
north and the direction to the
nearest settlement.
```

```
Realmic Evasion
Prerequisite: Speak the
Second Ideal
Before you’re hit by an attack,
spend 1 Investiture and test
Transportation (DC equals
triggering attack). On failure,
the attack grazes. On success,
the attack misses.
```

```
Cognitive Vision
When you use Transportation
to look into the Cognitive
Realm, you can learn an
enemy’s intent by testing
Transportation vs. Cognitive,
and you can learn about your
immediate environment.
```

```
Realmic Step
Test Transportation (DC 15)
and spend 2 Investiture to
transport yourself to a space
within spren bond range.
```

```
Shared
Transportation
Prerequisite: Transportation 4+
When you transport yourself,
spend 1 Investiture or more
to bring that many additional
characters with you.
```

```
Elsecalling
Prerequisite: Speak the
Third Ideal
Spend 1 Investiture to trans-
port yourself from the Physical
to the Cognitive Realm, or
test Transportation (DC 20)
and spend 2 Investiture to
transport from the Cognitive
to the Physical Realm.
```

```
Elsegate
Prerequisite: Speak the
Fourth Ideal
Transport yourself and up
to ten companions to an
Oathgate or permanent
perpendicularity you’ve visited
before.

Chapter 6: Surges 237
```

```
Transportation Talents
The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Transportation talent tree for the
Elsecaller and Willshaper paths.
```

```
Cognitive Farsight
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You can see greater distances into Shadesmar, and you
can use it to orient yourself.
When you peer into the Cognitive Realm with Trans-
portation, you can spot things up to a distance equal to
3 × your spren bond range.
Additionally, while you have 1 Investiture or more,
you always know both which direction is north and
which direction you must travel to reach the nearest
settlement or gathering of people.
Cognitive Vision
Prerequisite: Cognitive Farsight talent
Activation:
You can glean even greater knowledge and spot even
more hidden information when you peer into the
Cognitive Realm.
The following entries are added to the list of things you
can spot when you use Transportation to look into the
Cognitive Realm:
Learn Intent. Make a Transportation test as against
the Cognitive defense of an enemy you can sense. On
a success, you extrapolate their likely intentions based
on the spren lurking around them, and you can share
that information with your allies. That enemy gains a
disadvantage on their next test against you or one of
your allies.
Locate Objects. By briefly reaching into Shadesmar, you
can examine the various soul beads and their relative
locations in the bead ocean. This might reveal nearby
objects or other information about your immediate
environment, depending on which beads you touch.
As usual, spotting more difficult things might require
a Transportation test at the GM’s discretion.
```

```
Elsecalling
Prerequisite: Speak the Third Ideal; Realmic
Step talent
Activation:
You temporarily open a miniature perpendicularity
that allows you to travel between the Cognitive and
Physical Realms.
You can transport yourself from the Physical Realm to
the same location within the Cognitive Realm, or vice
versa, along with each object you’re wearing or carrying.
This movement doesn’t trigger Reactive Strikes.
If you’re in the Physical Realm, spend 1 Investiture
to transport yourself to the Cognitive Realm. Elsecalling
in this way is simple, requiring no skill test.
If you’re in the Cognitive Realm, make a DC 20
Transportation test. On a success, spend 2 Investiture
to transport yourself to the Physical Realm. On a failure,
you don’t spend Investiture or transport yourself; on a
later turn, you can attempt to Elsecall again.
```

```
Elsegate
Prerequisite: Speak the Fourth Ideal; Shared Trans-
portation talent
Activation:
You can create more stable perpendicularities that allow
you to transport yourself and others to highly Invested
locations, even across a significant distance.
After a long rest, you can instantly transport yourself
and up to ten more willing characters, along with each
object the targets are wearing or carrying. Choose an
Oathgate platform or permanent perpendicularity you’ve
visited before. After spending Investiture as described
below, you and the other targets are transported to that
destination.
This Transportation requires significant Investiture;
you must have infused spheres worth twice as many
marks as the number of characters you’re transporting,
and when you arrive, those spheres all become dun.
At the GM’s discretion, you might be able to choose
other destinations that are highly Invested locations
you’ve visited before.
```

```
The entire building shattered into thousands
upon thousands of small glass spheres, like beads.
Jasnah screamed as she fell backward through a dark sky.
She was no longer in the palace; she was somewhere else—
another land, another time, another ... something.
```

**238** Chapter 6: Surges

```
Realmic Evasion
Prerequisite: Speak the Second Ideal
Activation:
You dodge danger, momentarily transporting yourself
between the Physical and Cognitive Realms, then return
after the danger has passed.
Before you’re hit by an attack, you can use this reaction
and spend 1 Investiture to make a Transportation test.
The DC of this test equals the triggering attack’s test
result; you can choose whether to use this reaction after
you learn the DC. On a failure, the attack grazes instead
of hitting. On a success, the attack instead misses and
can’t graze.
```

```
Realmic Step
Prerequisite: Realmic Evasion talent
Activation:
You briefly slip into the Cognitive Realm, run a short
distance there, then reappear in the Physical Realm.
Make a DC 15 Transportation test. On a success, spend
2 Investiture to move through Shadesmar (along with
each object you’re wearing or carrying), transporting
yourself to an unoccupied space you can sense within
your spren bond range. This movement doesn’t trigger
Reactive Strikes.
If you are on or above a large body of water, using
this talent only costs 1 Investiture, as you don't have to
shape the sea of beads beneath yourself to move around.
Realmwalker
Prerequisite: Elsecalling talent
Activation:
You effortlessly step between the Cognitive and
Physical Realms.
When you make a Transportation test to use a Trans-
portation talent, you automatically succeed.
```

```
Shared Transportation
Prerequisite: Transportation 4+; Elsecalling talent
Activation:
You can keep your miniature perpendicularities open long
enough to bring others along.
When you move yourself through Shadesmar with
your Elsecalling or Realmic Step talent, you can
spend additional Investiture to also transport willing
characters within your reach, along with everything
they’re wearing or carrying. Spend 1 Investiture per
additional character you choose to transport.

**chapter** 7

## Items

```
Activating Items With Charges
Some items with charges must be activated in a special
way (such as by using the Interact action). If not
specified, you can expend a charge without spending
an action. When you expend a charge, you trigger that
item’s effect, then the charge is lost until you recharge
that item in the specified manner.
Recharging Items
An item with charges can be partially or fully recharged
during a short rest by draining the Stormlight from
unencased gemstones (see “Equipment”) or by drawing
from a Radiant’s current Investiture. The item regains
1 charge for each unencased gem or point of Invest-
iture infused into it.
Alternatively, an item can be fully recharged by being
left out in a highstorm (as with spheres).
```

```
Invested Items
Much like infused spheres, some items can hold a charge
of raging Stormlight or are otherwise connected to the
Cognitive or Spiritual Realm. These items are Invested
and can be more difficult to affect with surges and
other effects.
All Shardblades are Invested, along with any items
charged with Stormlight.
If an effect works differently on Invested items, this
is specified in the effect’s rules.
```

```
Items With Statistics
In this handbook, the names of items are usually listed
without special formatting. However, when it might
be helpful to know that a mentioned item has specific
rules or statistics, the item name appears in bold italics.
For example, a written adventure might state that
“the characters find a lockpick ”; this lets you know
that this isn’t just a narrative item, but that you should
check this chapter to find out how it works in the rules.
```

```
dventuring through the storm- and
war-torn world of Roshar can be a perilous
endeavor, and you’ll need gear to survive and
thrive. In addition to spheres—Roshar’s currency—
you’ll use adventuring kits, weapons, armor, and
equipment to meet your basic needs while journeying
throughout the continent. However, for exceedingly
long or distant expeditions, you may also want to know
about travel costs, including lodging, mounts, and
vehicles. You might even purchase the Stormlight-
powered marvels of engineering known as fabrials.
And if a character wants bespoke gear or a completely
unique fabrial of their own design, they can engage
in some crafting.
```

```
Using Items
Most rules for using items are presented in their specific
sections, but here are a few general rules that apply to
multiple kinds of items.
```

```
Expert Traits
Unless otherwise specified, you can use the items in
this chapter without any special expertise. However,
some weapons and armor have expert traits , giving
benefits that only apply if you have an expertise in that
weapon or armor.
```

```
Charges
Some items (such as fabrials) have one or more charges
that power certain effects; the number of charges is
determined when that item is created. Charges typically
represent the Investiture that can be stored in the gem
at that item’s core.
Individual items may contain more information on
how to use their charges, but the following rules apply
to all of them, unless otherwise specified.

Sphere Values in Diamond Marks
Gemstone Chip Mark Broam
Diamond 0.2 1 4
Garnet, heliodor, topaz 1 5 20
Ruby, smokestone, zircon 2 10 40
Amethyst, sapphire 5 25 100
Emerald 10 50 200
```

```
Using Spheres
In addition to serving as currency, spheres serve two
practical purposes in this game.
Spheres can be infused with Stormlight, holding the
energy and maintaining it for roughly five days before it
leaks away. Spheres with Stormlight are called infused ,
while spheres with no Stormlight are called dun.
Though chips can’t hold much Stormlight, infused
marks and broams are valued in part because they’re
bright enough to shed light in dark places. The
“Equipment” section later in this chapter presents
a lantern you can fill with infused spheres.
Even more importantly, Radiants can draw
Stormlight out of the gems to fuel Radiant abilities.
The “Stormlight Actions” section of chapter 5 details
how to calculate how much Stormlight you can draw
from your spheres.
```

```
Spheres
Most nations on Roshar use spheres as their primary
currency. Each sphere is a gemstone encased in a
glass bead, slightly flattened on one side to keep it from
rolling away. The glass beads are always the same size,
but the size and type of gemstone inside determines the
sphere’s value. From smallest to largest, the three sizes
of gem are:
Chip. Chips only contain a small sliver of a gem; these
are worth one-fifth of a mark.
Mark. Marks contain a half-carat gem and are worth
5 chips (or one-fourth of a broam).
Broam. Broams contain a sizable two-carat gem and
are worth 4 marks (or 20 chips).
For simplicity, this game tracks money using only
one denomination, “marks” (sometimes abbreviated
“mk”)—this always refers to a diamond mark.
However, on Roshar, spheres aren’t only counted in
chips, marks, and broams, but each is worth a different
amount depending on which type of gem it is. Spheres
can be made of diamond, garnet, heliodor, topaz, ruby,
smokestone, zircon, amethyst, sapphire or emerald.
These gems values depend on how useful they are in
Soulcasting—diamonds are the cheapest, whereas
emeralds are used to Soulcast food, making them
immensely valuable. You can find these conversions
on the Sphere Values in Diamond Marks table, but you
don’t need to remember these gems; if you ever receive
spheres in other denominations, the GM will simply tell
you their value in diamond marks.

Prisoner Kit
Weapons, Armor, and Spheres: None
Equipment: Manacles, ragged clothing
Connection: You’ve attracted a Radiant spren, and
through your trials, you’ve begun to connect with
them. Speak with your GM and choose a spren
type appropriate for your character, then record
their information on the back of your character
sheet in “Connections.” If you later choose the
key talent from this spren’s corresponding Radiant
path, immediately check two boxes for that talent’s
“Speak the First Ideal” goal.

Weapons: Two light weapons
Armor: Leather armor
Equipment: Backpack with common clothing, alcohol
(bottle of Horneater white), a crowbar, a lockpick,

```

```
Weapons
Since the arrival of the Everstorm, it’s dangerous to
travel unarmed, and even the most peaceful characters
often take up weapons for self-defense.
This section outlines the most common weapons
found on Roshar. The Weapons table includes the
following columns:
Type. The general type of weapon—but feel free to
creatively describe your own, as long as it uses the
same statistics.
Skill. The skill you test when attacking with this weapon.
Damage. How much damage the weapon deals when it
hits or grazes.
Range. How far away the weapon can attack (see the
upcoming “Weapon Range” section).
Traits. Special rules that apply to that weapon (see the
upcoming “Weapon Traits” section).
Expert Traits. Special rules that apply only if you have
an expertise in that weapon. Some weapons remove
an undesirable trait if you have expertise, rather than
adding a desirable trait; for example, if you have an
expertise in Longswords, your longsword loses its
Two-Handed trait so you can wield it with one hand.
Weight. The weapon’s weight.
Price. The weapon’s standard price.
See the “Attacking” section of chapter 10 for the
full rules about attacking using these weapons.
```

Starting Kits

During step 6 of character creation, you choose one
of the following sets of equipment. Each **starting kit**
grants items such as spheres (roll the dice indicated to
determine how many marks you start with), weapons or
armor (see the Weapons table and Armor table later in
this chapter), other equipment (see the Equipment table
later in this chapter), and more.

Academic Kit
**Weapons:** One knife, sling, or staff
**Armor:** Uniform
**Equipment:** Backpack with common clothing,
an ink pen, a bottle of ink, 10 sheets of paper,
3 empty vials, a block of wax, a reference book on
a topic of your choice (approved by the GM), and
1 dose of weak poison
**Spheres:** A pouch containing 3d12 marks
**Additional Expertise:** You gain the Literature
expertise. If you already have this expertise, you
instead gain one cultural or utility expertise of your
choice. This expertise doesn’t count against your
expertises chosen at character creation.

Artisan Kit
**Weapons:** One hammer or light weapon (your choice)
**Armor:** Leather armor
**Equipment:** Chest with common clothing, surgical
supplies, 5 doses of weak antiseptic, an ink pen,
a bottle of ink, 5 sheets of parchment, 5 candles,
a flint and steel, 3 empty glass bottles, a tuning fork,
a musical instrument of your choice, and a scale
**Spheres:** A pouch containing 4d8 marks

Military Kit
**Weapons:** Two non-special weapons
**Armor:** Uniform and chain armor
**Equipment:** Backpack with common clothing,
a waterskin, a flint and steel, a whetstone, a blanket,
and 10 days of food rations
**Spheres:** A pouch containing 2d6 marks

Courtier Kit
**Weapons:** One sidesword, greatsword, longsword,
or longbow
**Armor:** None
**Equipment:** Alcohol (bottle of violet wine),
fine clothing
**Spheres:** A pouch containing 4d20 marks
**Connection:** You’re supported by a patron of your
noble house (see the “Patrons” section of chapter 8).
This affords you accommodations and a certain
standard of living.

```
Chapter 7: Items 243
```

```
Some characters might wield their weapons using
methods other than hands. You can do this if you’re only
wielding weapons that another character could with two
hands. When you do, pick which weapon is considered
your “main hand” and “off hand” (regardless of how
you hold them), and otherwise follow the weapon rules.
Unless your GM decides otherwise, you can’t wield more
than two weapons (or one Two-Handed weapon) at a
time, regardless of whether you use your hands to do so.
```

```
Ammunition
If your weapon has the Loaded or Ranged trait, you
don’t need to purchase its ammunition or track it on
your character sheet (unless the weapon uses special
ammunition). However, the Loaded trait does limit
how many shots you can make with a weapon before
reloading. It’s assumed you can always obtain or
improvise standard ammunition for your weapons,
unless the GM decides you’re in an unusual situation
where ammunition is unavailable.
```

```
Weapons in Polite Company
Despite the constant presence of war on Roshar—or
maybe because of it—weapons aren’t welcome in most
“polite” parts of society throughout the world. Openly
carrying a weapon in settings such as a market or at a
party often draws attention, hostility, or the authorities.
If you want to carry a weapon in such context, you usually
have to conceal it (such as with a Stealth test).
Light weapons are much more common off the
battlefield than are heavy weapons. While their presence
may still be unwelcome in some situations, they don’t have
the same chilling effect on friendly conversations between
strangers, and they’re wielded by people from all walks
of life. Weapons with the Discreet trait are even more
acceptable (or easier to hide) in most contexts.
```

```
Wielding Weapons
Each weapon requires one hand to wield unless other-
wise specified in its traits. While wielding a weapon,
you can use it to attack or use other abilities. Rules that
apply to “your weapon” only apply if you’re wielding
that weapon.
If you aren’t wielding a weapon (or holding an object)
in a hand, you have that hand free for other abilities
that require it. If both of your hands are full but an
ability doesn’t state you need a hand free, it’s up to the
GM to decide whether you could reasonably use that
ability in the narrative.
```

```
Drawing Weapons
You can use the Interact action to draw a weapon in
your possession and grasp it in your hand. After you do,
you’re wielding that weapon and can use it for attacks
and other effects.
You can use the Drop free action to release a weapon
you’re holding (for example, right before you Interact
to draw a different weapon). When a scene begins and
you’re not Surprised, it’s assumed you can instinctively
draw your weapons before the first round (without using
the Interact action). If you’re Surprised when a scene
begins, you can’t instinctively draw your weapons.
Offhand Weapons
While wielding more than one weapon, you must choose
which one is in your main hand. Attacks with that
weapon are made as usual.
When you wield a weapon that’s not in your main
hand, it’s in your offhand. Before you use the Strike
action using a weapon in your off hand, you must spend
2 focus. (Attacks other than the Strike action don’t
require spending that focus.)

```
Discreet. This weapon is less obtrusive than others,
and thus less likely to be confiscated in secure settings.
In non-combat scenes, you gain an advantage on
any test you make to disguise this weapon, to hide
it on your person, or to convince others not to take
it from you.
Fragile. When you attack with this weapon, the GM
can spend C to cause it to break after the attack
is resolved.
Indirect. This ranged weapon can arc shots over cover
and obscuring terrain. If a target isn’t in your line of
effect but you can sense them, you can still attack them
with this weapon if there’s a reasonably open path for
your projectile to indirectly arc to them. Your target
can’t benefit from the Brace action against attacks
made with this weapon.
Loaded [X]. This weapon stores ammunition equal to
the number indicated in brackets. To make a ranged
attack with this weapon, you must spend 1 stored
ammunition. As , you can reload this weapon to full
ammunition. The GM can spend C from an attack
with this weapon to reduce your stored ammunition;
after they do, the weapon only has only one shot
remaining.
Momentum. When you attack using this weapon, if you
already moved at least 10 feet in a straight line toward
your target on this turn, you gain an advantage on
the attack.
Offhand. While wielding this weapon in your offhand,
it only costs you 1 focus (instead of 2) to Strike with it.
Pierce. This weapon’s damage can’t be reduced by the
target’s deflect value.
Quickdraw. You can use the Interact action as to draw
this weapon.
Thrown [X/Y]. You can throw this weapon at a target,
making a ranged attack when you do (see “Ranged
Attacks” in chapter 10). The two numbers in brackets
express the weapon’s short and long range; as with
ranged weapons, you gain a disadvantage when
attacking a target outside short range. Once the
weapon is thrown, it is lost until you recover it from
your target.
Two-Handed. You must wield this weapon in two
hands, not just one. When you attack with it, it uses
both hands.
Unique. This weapon has unique rules. These are
detailed either in the weapon description or
immediately following the word “Unique” in the
Weapons table (for example, “Unique: loses Two-
Handed trait”).
```

Weapon Range

Weapons can only attack targets within a certain range.
Each weapon is classified as either a melee weapon
or a ranged weapon. See “Targeting and Range” in
chapter 10 for more information on range and reach.

Melee Weapons
You can use a **melee weapon** that you’re wielding
to attack a target within your reach (see “Reach” in
chapter 10).
When wielded, some melee weapons increase your
reach for attacks made with that weapon. On the
Weapons table, if a melee weapon’s range lists a number
in brackets, increase your reach by that many feet. For
example, if you usually have a 5-foot reach, a Melee [+5]
weapon extends your reach to 10 feet.

Ranged Weapons
You can fire ammunition from a **ranged weapon**
that you’re wielding, attacking a target either within
or beyond your reach. The weapon’s range lists two
numbers in brackets, such as Ranged [80/320]; the first
number is the weapon’s short range in feet, and the
second is the weapon’s long range in feet. As described
in “Targeting and Range” in chapter 10, ranged attacks
outside short range gain a disadvantage.
Additionally, as described in “Attacking” in chapter
10, you gain a disadvantage on ranged attacks while
within an enemy’s reach. If you attack a target within
5 feet of your ally, raise the stakes; a Complication risks
grazing your ally.

Weapon Traits

These rules apply to any weapon with that trait listed
in its entry on the Weapons table.

**Cumbersome [X].** To wield this weapon easily, your
Strength score must be equal to or greater than the
number indicated in brackets. If your Strength is
lower than that number, you gain a disadvantage on
all attacks using this weapon and are Slowed while
wielding it.
**Dangerous.** The GM can spend C from an attack with
this weapon to cause you to also accidentally graze an
ally within the weapon’s reach or range. This deals the
usual damage for a graze.
**Deadly.** When you hit a target with this weapon, you
can spend to cause the target to immediately suffer
an injury.
**Defensive.** While wielding this weapon, you can use the
Brace action without cover nearby.

Unarmed Attacks
Punches, kicks, thrown elbows, headbutts, and bites
are examples of unarmed attacks. You can make an
unarmed attack using Athletics.
Expertise. Unlike other entries on the Special
Weapons table, you can choose Unarmed Attacks as
a weapon expertise.
Unique Traits. Unarmed attacks add the following
unique traits:
Always Available. Unarmed attacks don’t count as
weapon attacks, but they are melee attacks intrinsic to
each character. You don’t have to be holding a weapon
to make an unarmed attack, and you can’t be disarmed
of your unarmed attacks. You can make an unarmed
attack even if each of your hands is holding something,
but if your second Strike on a turn is an unarmed
attack, it follows the rules for an offhand attack.
Strength Training. When you make an unarmed attack,
its damage die is based on your Strength score, as
shown on the Unarmed Damage table.
```

```
Unarmed Damage
Strength Unarmed Damage
0–2 1 impact (no die roll)
3–4 1d4 impact
5–6 1d8 impact
7–8 2d6 impact
9+ 2d10 impact
```

```
Improvised Weapons
In the heat of the moment, you might wish to attack
with an object that isn’t a traditional weapon (such
as hitting someone with a pot) or use a weapon in an
unconventional way (such as swinging a shortbow at
someone like a staff ). If you can pick an object up in one
or both hands, you can use it as an improvised weapon!
Expertise. Unlike other entries on the Special
Weapons table, you can choose Improvised Weapons as
a weapon expertise. If you do, your improvised weapon
attacks benefit from the expert traits of the weapon most
similar to it, even if you don’t have expertise in that
similar weapon.
Using an Improvised Weapon. When you attack
with an improvised weapon, the GM decides which
non-special light or heavy weapon it is most similar to.
Make the attack as though with that weapon, but add
the Fragile trait (see “Weapon Traits”).
```

```
Specialist Expertises
The expert traits of each weapon and armor require a
specific expertise (see “Expertises” in chapter 3). For
most weapons and armor, you can choose that expertise
when creating or leveling up your character. However,
some items from this chapter require specialist expertises
to benefit from expert traits. The following specialist
expertises can only be obtained through either talents,
rewards, or training (see “Downtime” in chapter 9):
Grandbow, Half-Shard, Shardblade, Shardplate, and
Warhammer.

Half-Shards
Half-shards are diamond-shaped, two-handed kite
shields with a special augmenter fabrial on the back,
allowing them to resist the blows of Shardblades. Like
normal shields, half-shards are designed primarily for
defense, but they can also be wielded as weapons.
Unique Traits. Half-shards have the following
unique traits:
Charges (1 charge). A half-shard reinforces itself using
Stormlight from its fabrial’s gems. A normal half-shard
has 1 charge (though some might have more); while
it has at least 1 charge, it is Invested. Before you take
damage while wielding a half-shard, you can expend
a charge (no action required) to increase your deflect
value by 10 against that attack, then until the attack is
resolved, your deflect value applies to all damage types.
(When it fits the story, your GM might decide you
aren’t protected from some sources of damage, such
as extreme cold.)
Recharging. Half-shards can be recharged in the usual
manner (see “Using Items” at the beginning of this
chapter), either via unencased gems or a Radiant.
However, half-shard charges require significantly more
Investiture than most fabrials, requiring 5 Investiture
or 5 gems (instead of 1) to restore a single charge.
```

```
Shardblades and
Radiant Shardblades
Shardblades are among the most priceless items on
Roshar. These weapons are five to six feet long, at least
a handspan wide, gleamingly ornate, and shockingly
light. They can cut through nearly anything like a hot
knife through chull lard, and their bonded owner can
summon them from thin air.
Shardblades are composed of an unknown metal,
with a gemstone fitted within their hilt or guard.
Unlike non-Invested weaponry, Shardblades can
cut cleanly through almost any non-living material—
including non-Invested stone and metal—with the ease
of slicing through water. In addition, these Blades pass
through living organisms without the usual mark or
injury, slicing through soul rather than flesh and bone.
When the core of a limb is “severed” by a Shardblade,
everything beyond that cut becomes Blade-dead—
gray and lifeless. If this happens to a character’s spine
or head, their eyes burn out and they instantly die.
shardblade

```
Chapter 7: Items 249
```

SAMI RYTKÖNEN

```
Unique Traits. Shardblades add the following
unique traits:
Summoning/Dismissing. Once bonded (see “Bonding
a Shardblade”), a Shardblade takes ten heartbeats to
summon. When you use the Interact action to draw
your Shardblade, it doesn’t materialize in your hand
until the start of your next turn. You can dismiss your
Shardblade with a mere thought (no action required),
then it disappears into mist until you need it again.
Spiritual Injury. Shardblades are an Invested weapon
that can sever a person’s spirit. When a Shardblade
causes a target to make an injury roll (such as by
reducing them to 0 health or triggering the weapon’s
Deadly trait), determine the injury by rolling on the
Shardblade Injury Duration table without adding the
target’s deflect value (instead of rolling on the Injury
Duration table in chapter 9).
```

```
Shardblade Injury Duration
Injury Roll Injury
16+ Flesh Wound. The character suffers a temporary
injury for the remainder of the day.
1–15 Spiritual Injury. The target suffers a permanent
injury. Any severed flesh turns gray and lifeless.
Non-Invested healing can’t heal this injury.
0 or lower Death. The character dies (see “Death”).
```

```
Bonding a Shardblade
You can use a Shardblade’s attached gem to bond to
that blade. This process usually takes about 5 days,
though you can choose to break this bond with only
a few moments of concentration. Once you bond to a
Shardblade, you can summon it anywhere by willing
it to happen—ten heartbeats later, it coalesces from
mist into your hand. If your bonded Shardblade leaves
your hand, it instantly dissipates again unless you will
it not to.
You can have multiple Shardblades bound at a time,
but each Shardblade can be bound to only one character
at a time. You can only bond another character’s Shard-
blade if they are dead or willingly broke their bond.
Radiant Shardblades
Thousands of years ago, the people of Roshar lost the
knowledge of what Shardblades are made from and
how to create them. However, certain characters—
including ancient beings, higher-Ideal Radiants, and
people associated with them—know what Shardblades
truly are: the corpses of Radiant spren, killed when
their bonded knights forswore their oaths during
the Recreance.
```

**shardblade**

**250** Chapter 7: Items

```
SAMI RYTKÖNEN
```

```
Radiants of the Third Ideal or higher can wield
“living” Shardblades, their bonded spren physically
manifested in the form of a weapon. Such a Blade can
be summoned whenever its spren is ready (instead
of requiring ten heartbeats as those of dead-spren
Shardblades do). Unlike other Shardblades, glyphs and
symbols usually glow on the blade, though you can cause
yours to look like a “dead” Blade whenever you wish.
While you wield your Radiant Shardblade, you can
telepathically communicate with your spren. However,
while in Blade form, the spren can’t use abilities that
require them to move independently.
Unique Traits. Radiant Shardblades add the
following unique traits:
Faster Summoning. When you use the Interact action
to draw your Radiant Shardblade, it immediately
materializes in your hand. You can dismiss your
Radiant Shardblade with a mere thought (no action
required), and it disappears into mist until you
need it again.
Malleable Form. You can use to change the shape
of your Radiant Shardblade, choosing any non-special
melee weapon on the Weapons table. Your Blade uses
that weapon’s skill and gains that weapon’s traits for
as long as it’s in that shape; if you have an expertise
in the chosen weapon, it gains those expert traits as
well. You roll double the normal damage dice for that
weapon (for example, a Shard longspear rolls 2d8
damage instead of 1d8), and it deals spirit damage
instead of that weapon’s normal type.
Radiant Shardblade. Your Radiant Shardblade
has Faster Summoning instead of the Summoning/
Dismissing trait, and it doesn’t have the Dangerous
trait of other Shardblades. Otherwise, it follows the
rules for ordinary Shardblades.
```

```
Warhammers
Rosharan warhammers have hafts as thick as a warrior’s
wrist and a metal head nearly the size of a warrior’s
torso. Due to their enormous weight, warhammers
usually can usually only be wielded by people in
Shardplate. Consequently, warhammers are commonly
called Shardhammers, despite being made of mundane
materials.
Unique Traits. If you have the Warhammer special-
ist expertise, add the following special expert trait:
Crushing Weight. When you hit a character of your
size or smaller with an attack using this weapon, you
can also push them horizontally up to 10 feet. When
you do, you can also spend to choose any number
of other characters of your size or smaller within your
reach, pushing them the same direction and distance.
```

Radiants Wielding Non-Radiant Shardblades
Radiants who try to wield a non-Radiant Shardblade
hear incessant, agonized screaming. If you have a First
Ideal key talent, you become Disoriented and gain a
disadvantage on all tests while you’re touching or holding
such a Shardblade. At the start of your turn, you can spend
3 focus to temporarily ignore this effect until the start of
your next turn.

Armor
With war raging across Roshar, armor is a very
common sight, though it’s often still frowned on in
polite society. While wearing armor, you stand out
in polite society. This might result in standing out
like a sore thumb, getting turned away from certain
locations, or gaining a disadvantage on tests made to
influence civilians in most non-military contexts, such
as banquets, markets, or churches.
This section outlines the most common types of
armor found on Roshar. You can only benefit from one
type of armor at once, and you can’t put on armor or
take it off while in combat or in situations where it’s
hard to move. The Armor table includes the follow-
ing columns:
Type. The general type of armor—but feel free to
creatively describe your own, as long as it uses the
same statistics.
Deflect Value. Reduce all incoming impact, keen, and
energy damage by the deflect value of the armor you’re
wearing (see “Deflect” in chapter 3).
Traits. Special rules that apply to that armor (see the
upcoming “Armor Traits” section).
Expert Traits. Special rules that apply only if you have
an expertise in that armor. Some armors remove
an undesirable trait if you have expertise, rather
than adding a desirable trait; for example, if you
have an expertise in Chain Armor, your chain loses
its Cumbersome trait so you can wear it with any
Strength score.
Weight. The armor’s weight.
Price. The armor’s standard price.
```

```

```

```
Armor Traits
These rules apply to any armor with that trait listed in
its entry on the Armor table.
Cumbersome [X]. To wear this armor easily, your
Strength score must be equal to or greater than the
number indicated in brackets. If your Strength is lower
than that number, you’re Slowed while wearing this
armor and you gain a disadvantage on all tests that
use your Speed attribute.
Dangerous. The GM can spend C that you gain while
wearing this armor to cause your uncontrolled motion
to injure an ally with 5 feet of you, dealing 2d6
impact damage.
Presentable. This unobtrusive armor is presentable to
wear in public in a non-military context. You don’t
suffer undue attention for wearing this armor or gain a
disadvantage on tests for doing so in conversations.
Unique. This armor has unique rules detailed immed-
iately following the word “Unique” in the Armor table
(for example, “Unique: loses Cumbersome trait”).

Shardplate and
Radiant Shardplate
Shardplate is just as highly sought-after as Shardblades.
Each set provides full-body armor that enhances the
physical capabilities and durability of its wielder, blocks
strikes from Shardblades, and protects its wearer from
all but the most powerful Invested abilities.
Shardplate is made from thick interlocking plates
of an unknown, monumentally heavy metal. On the
interior of each set’s breastplate, an apparatus of gems
charges the Plate with Stormlight and allows the use of
its Invested properties. When the Plate’s wearer closes
their helmet’s mask, it becomes partially translucent,
allowing for a much greater range of vision than in
mundane helmets.
A person wearing infused Shardplate isn’t hampered
by its weight; instead, it greatly increases their strength
and agility. Perhaps even more importantly, the
armor has a remarkable ability to repel the strikes
of Shardblades.
Despite these qualities, Shardplate can be difficult
to use effectively. It requires gems infused with Storm -
light to function, and donning or doffing it with any
speed requires a team of trained professionals.
Without Stormlight, Plate is little more than dead
weight, and it can cease functioning when it takes
significant damage. However, unlike other armor,
Plate’s damaged pieces can regenerate; given enough
time and Storm light, you can use the breastplate’s gem
apparatus to regrow the missing pieces of a set of Plate,
almost like a living organism.
Transporting Shardplate can also be difficult due
to its weight, usually requiring a chull-drawn cart
(described in “Travel” later in this chapter). This
particularly matters when tracking your carrying
capacity (see “Strength” in chapter 3).
Unique Traits. Shardplate adds the following
unique traits:
Charges (4 charges). Shardplate reinforces itself using
Stormlight from its gems. An average set of Shardplate
has 4 charges (though special sets might have more).
Before you take damage while wearing Shardplate,
you can expend a charge to increase your deflect value
against that damage by 10. While the armor has at
least 1 charge, it is Invested. When the armor runs
out of charges, it no longer functions correctly; until
recharged, it gains the Cumbersome [6] trait, and it
loses the Enhanced Attributes and Invested Ability
Protection traits.
```

**254** Chapter 7: Items

```
SAMI RYTKÖNEN
```

```
Breakable. Lucky hits against Shardplate can shatter
plates of the armor, causing Stormlight to leak out.
After you’re hit by an attack while wearing Shardplate,
your opponent can spend from that attack to cause
your Shardplate to lose 1 charge.
Recharging. Shardplate can be recharged in the usual
manner (see “Using Items” at the beginning of this
chapter), either via unencased gems or a Radiant.
However, Shardplate charges require significantly more
Investiture than most fabrials, requiring 5 Investiture
or 5 gems (instead of 1) to restore a single charge.
Enhanced Attributes. While wearing the armor, you
become Enhanced [+2 Strength] and Enhanced
[+2 Speed].
Invested Ability Protection. While wearing this armor,
your Invested ability tests gain a disadvantage, Invested
ability tests against you gain a disadvantage, and your
deflect value applies to all damage types. (When it fits
the story, your GM might decide you aren’t protected
from some sources of damage, such as extreme cold.)
Radiant Shardplate
Radiants of the Fourth Ideal or higher can wield
“living” Shardplate, which usually glows with a
luminescent light. The armor is composed of common
spren; these spren usually follow the Radiant unseen,
but they can be called on to manifest into armor.
You can also choose for your Radiant Shardplate
to look like “dead” Plate, which doesn’t glow.
Unique Traits. Radiant Shardplate has the follow-
ing unique traits:
Living Armor. You can use to summon or dismiss
any number of your armor pieces on your body (for
example, to remove your helmet). Dismissing a few
pieces doesn’t change your armor’s function unless
you wish it to. Your armor maintains its count of
charges when dismissed.
Restraining Armor. You can summon the armor
around a character you can sense within 20 feet of you
who is willing, unaware of your presence or location,
or Surprised. When you try to summon it around an
unwilling character, you must succeed on a Discipline
test against their Physical defense. While the armor is
around a character other than you, they gain all the
benefits of wearing Shardplate, but they also become
Restrained. Whenever this character takes damage,
they automatically expend one of the armor’s charges
to increase their deflect value by 10 against that
damage. The Restrained condition ends and the armor
is dismissed when you choose to dismiss it, when it
drops to 0 charges, or when the character or an ally
```

```
within reach of them succeeds on an Athletics test
against the wearer’s Physical defense (via the Use a
Skill action).
Natural Recovery. Radiant Shardplate naturally
restores its charges over time, though if you wish, you
can recharge it quickly using the normal rules. After a
long rest, your Shardplate regains all its charges.
Radiant Shardplate. Your Radiant Shardplate doesn’t
have the Dangerous trait of other Shardplate, and it
doesn’t add a disadvantage to your Invested tests.
It otherwise follows the rules for ordinary Shardplate.
```

```
GM Tip: Rewarding Items
Some things on Roshar are so precious and powerful that
they can’t be purchased: Ryshadium steeds, Shardblades,
Shardplate, Soulcasters, and the gems required to create
unique fabrials. Players can only acquire these items
through rewards (see chapter 8), whether for completing
a goal or through narrative means.
```

ANTTI HAKOSAARI

```
Personal Items
This chapter provides statistics for common objects
that interact with the game rules. However, this isn’t a
comprehensive list of everything that exists on Roshar!
Feel free to carry other personal items that have meaning
to your character, add flavor to your actions, or similarly
deepen the narrative. Just remember that such personal
items can’t provide you mechanical advantages in the
game—you can’t suddenly declare you have a perfect
infused gem in your pocket that didn’t exist before. But
otherwise, be creative.
For example, you might decide your character has a
sweet tooth and constantly snacks on sweets. Sweets
aren’t on the item list, but you can still use it to add
interesting details to the story. When you’re in a solemn
audience with royalty, you might describe how you pull a
sweet from your sock, pop it in your mouth, and crunch it
loudly—no need to establish where you bought the sweet
from or how much it cost! Just remember that you can’t
use these narratively conjured sweets to bribe guards,
to nourish yourself when rations run out, or to barter for
items on the equipment list—all of those uses have a
mechanical impact on the game.
```

```
Equipment
This section presents everyday Rosharan tools and
resources that are commonly applicable to your
adventures. The Equipment table lists each item’s
name, weight, and price, then the text that follows
describes each item’s benefits.
Some items in this section have variable prices,
as many variations on that item can be found across
Roshar. For example, Vorin wines range dramatically
in value, and some reference books are much rarer than
others. The GM chooses how much an individual item
costs within its range, and they might grant tangential
benefits to the higher-priced varieties. For example,
spending extra money on a blue wine, rather than a
red, might lower your DC on a test made to influence
a connoisseur.
Alcohol. Every culture of Roshar has its own
intoxicating traditions, such as beers, mudbeers, ciders,
honu, shiki, juices, and lagers.
In Vorin society, almost all forms of alcohol are
referred to as “wine” regardless of their ingredients.
Such wines are known by their distinct colors, which are
infused into each beverage so they can be distinguished
at a glance. From least intoxicating to most, the types
of wine are:
```

```
Color Effect
Pink Noted as being floral and aiding alertness.
Less intoxicating than milk.
Orange A non-intoxicating wine that tastes of fruit with
notes of ginger. Most popular with members of the
clergy.
Yellow Offers a bold and deep flavor “without guilt.”
Minimally intoxicating.
Auburn Spicy with an earthy aroma. Brewed with
fermented fruit.
Red Flavorful wine with a pleasant burn.
Sapphire Nutty with notes of honey, made with fermented
lavis grain.
Blue Carries complex notes of berry and lemon.
Violet Potent liquor with an aroma of spiced sandalwood.
Considered the most flavorful of the wines.
```

```
Anesthetic. Usually made from fathom bark or
winterwort, you can apply a dose of anesthetic ointment
to an injury after a short or long rest to reduce its
recovery time by 1d4 days. Each injury can be treated
with anesthetic only once per day.
Antiseptic (potent). Knobweed milk, fourleaf
sap, and lister’s oil can all be used to make a strong
antiseptic. A dose can be applied to a character after
a short rest to restore 2d6 health.

Antiseptic (weak). A dose of weak antiseptic, such
as that made from larmic mucus, can be applied to a
character after a short rest to restore 1d6 health.
Book (reference). Each reference book contains
information on a particular topic, such as a historical
era, engineering, biology, architecture, or crafting
a particular type of fabrial. When you have time to
reference a book while making a related test using
your Intellect attribute, you’re considered to have
an expertise in the topic (see “Expertise Benefits”
in chapter 3).
Candle. While lit, the candle sheds light in a
15-foot radius. It burns for up to 6 hours before
becoming unusable.
Case (leather). A sealable, cylindrical case that can
store up to ten pages of paper or parchment and protect
them from the weather.
Chain (thick). This sturdy chain can be used in
securing cargo, shackling prisoners, and other situations
where strength is essential. This chain can be broken
by succeeding on a DC 30 Athletics test or by dealing
15 damage to it.
Chain (thin). This thin chain is often used in
jewelry and Soulcasters, usually made of precious metals
in fine links. This chain can be broken by succeeding on
a DC 20 Athletics test or by dealing 5 damage to it.
Clothing (common). Plain clothes are made of
affordable materials and are generally undyed, helping
you fit in among the commonfolk. While wearing these
clothes, you gain an advantage on spiritual tests made
to convince others you’re from the lower class.
Clothing (fine). Fine clothes are made of silks or
other high-quality materials, colored using expensive
dyes, and often stitched with fine embroidery. Wearing
fine clothes helps you to blend into high society, such
as noble banquets, without arousing suspicion. While
wearing these clothes, you gain an advantage on
spiritual tests made to convince others you’re from
the upper class.
Clothing (ragged). This clothing may have once
been of fine or common make, but it’s now barely
holding together. While wearing these clothes, you gain
an advantage on spiritual tests made to convince others
you’re destitute.
Crowbar. You can use a crowbar to gain an
advantage on Athletics tests where the crowbar’s
leverage can be applied.
Ear Tr umpet. Distant sounds heard through an
ear trumpet can be perceived as though at half the
distance. At the GM’s discretion, more powerful ear
trumpets may be available at higher prices.

Flint and Steel. A flint and steel can be used as to
light abundant fuel within reach. Starting a fire under
more challenging circumstances can take 1 minute or
more. Herdazians often wear a tool called a sparkflicker
as jewelry or other ornamentation; they can use this
like flint and steel by quickly running their crystalline
fingernails along it.
Food (ration). Rations are foods created for
extended travel, such as jerky and hard-baked lavis
cakes. They generally lack flavor, but if kept dry,
they remain edible indefinitely.
Food (street). Every culture of Roshar has its own
street confections, ranging from loaves of bread to more
specific cultural foods like Herdazian chouta.

```
Food (fine). Fine food can be found in high-class
restaurants and on the tables of nobles’ feasts.
Grappling Hook. A grappling hook is typically
attached to the end of a rope to aid in scaling or
descending from walls and cliffs. A securely anchored
grappling hook grants an advantage on Acrobatics and
Athletics tests made to climb using its attached rope.
You can use an Interact action to attach the grappling
hook to an anchor within reach without making a test.
Alternatively, you can throw and attach it to a suitable
anchor within 20 feet of you by succeeding on an
Athletics or Agility test (DC set by the GM).
Lantern (oil). While lit, this lantern sheds light in a
30-foot radius. It burns for up to 6 hours per pint of oil.
Lantern (sphere). This lantern includes a locked
cage, usually just under 1 foot in diameter, into which
infused spheres can be placed to shed light. Depending
on how full the lantern is, it sheds a different radius of
light: 60 feet when entirely filled with spheres, 30 feet
when half full, 15 feet when quarter-filled, and 5 feet
when at least 1 mark or broam is within it. The lock can
be opened with its included key or a successful DC 15
Thievery test.
Lock and Key. This sturdy lock can be opened with
its included key or a successful DC 20 Thievery test.
At the GM’s discretion, locks that require higher DCs
may be available at higher prices.
Lockpick. You can use a lockpick to gain an
advantage on Thievery tests made to pick a lock. After
this test is resolved, the GM can spend C to cause the
lockpick to break.
Magnifying Lens. You can use a magnifying lens
to gain an advantage on skill tests made to appraise or
inspect a small or highly detailed item.
Manacles. These metal restraints, which come with
a key, can bind the wrists or ankles of a Large or smaller
character. They can be escaped with a successful DC 25
Agility test, broken by succeeding on a DC 25 Athletics
test or by dealing 15 damage to them, or lockpicked
by succeeding on a DC 20 Thievery test. At the GM’s
discretion, manacles that require higher DCs may be
available at higher prices.
Musical Instrument. Every culture of Roshar
has its preferred instruments and musical stylings.
Instruments are often used for enjoyment, passing time,
or busking for chips. When playing an instrument,
you can determine the quality of your performance
by making a skill test using a related skill (such as
Agility for a stringed instrument, Athletics for drums,
or Discipline for an instrument with many keys). If
you have an expertise in that instrument, you gain
an advantage on the test. manacles
```

```
Net (hunting). This net of thick rope can ensnare
animals or enemies. While holding this net, you can
use to make an Athletics test against the Physical
defense of a Large or smaller character within 15 feet of
you. On a hit, the character is Restrained and knocked
Prone. That character or another within reach can
use the Interact action to make a DC 15 Athletics test,
freeing the trapped character on a success. If a character
is Restrained by multiple nets, they must be freed from
each separately.
Net (fishing). This net of fine mesh is used to
ensnare fish. You can use this net to gain an advantage
on physical tests related to fishing.
Oil. Oil generally comes in a 1-pint flask made of
dried crem. Oil is flammable and can be used to fuel oil
lanterns, to create dangerous terrain in a space, or as
an improvised weapon (sling). When you hit or graze a
target with this improvised weapon, you coat the target
in oil in addition to the normal damage. Following the
attack, regardless of the result, the crem flask breaks and
any unused oil is lost.
Poison. Often manufactured using Roshar’s deadly
blackbane plant, poison comes in single-dose glass vials.
As , you can pour it into food, liquid, or a container,
or you can apply the poison to a melee weapon or a
piece of ammunition you’re holding. When you do, the
GM may require you to make a Stealth test to avoid
discovery. When a character ingests the poison or is hit
by an attack using the poisoned weapon or ammunition,
the poison is expended, and the character suffers the
following effects:
Weak Poison. The target must succeed on a DC 12
Athletics test or take 1d6 vital damage.
Effectual Poison. The target must succeed on a DC 14
Athletics test or take 2d8 vital damage and be Stunned
for 1 hour.
Potent Poison. The target must succeed on a DC 16
Athletics test or take 3d10 vital damage and be
Stunned for 1 hour. While Stunned in this way,
the target is Immobilized.

Pulley System. Most commonly used by engineers
and artifabrians, this system includes four pulley wheels,
30 feet of rope, and a hook. When you have time to set
up a pulley apparatus before lifting an object, you treat
the object as being a quarter of its normal weight.
Rope. Rope is usually made of seasilk (or less com-
monly, lavis grain or rockbud fibers) and sold in 50-foot
lengths that can be cut and tied to change its length as
needed. It can be cut by dealing 2 damage to it, or it can
be ripped apart with a successful DC 20 Athletics test.
Scale. Most commonly used by scholars, ardents,
appraisers, and gem cutters, a scale can accurately
determine the weight of an object (to a maximum
of 2 pounds).
Spyglass. Distant objects viewed through a spyglass
can be perceived as though at half the distance. At the
GM’s discretion, spyglasses that allow distant objects to
appear even closer may be available at higher prices.
Surgical Supplies. This satchel contains enough
bandages, salves, splints, and other medical supplies
to be used 10 times. When you make a Medicine test
to treat a wounded character (or to similarly use these
medical supplies), you can expend one of these uses to
gain an advantage on the test.
Treat ment (medical). Rosharan surgeons treat
ailments with a variety of treatments, generally made
from bitterleaf or bloodivy. During a short rest, you can
use a dose of such a treatment to cure a character of one
of the following conditions, given that its source isn’t a
permanent injury: Disoriented, Exhausted (reduces the
penalty by 1), or Stunned.
Tu n i n g Fork. A tuning fork can transfer Stormlight
from one sphere or gemstone to another. While using
a tuning fork, you can use spheres to recharge fabrials,
Shardplate, and half-shards as if the spheres were
unencased gemstones.
Unencased Gem (infused). Unlike spheres with
gemstones encased in glass, unencased gems leak Storm-
light quickly, going dun within several days depending
on their cut. This permeability allows unencased gems
to recharge fabrials and Shardplate. Radiants can also
breathe in Stormlight from unencased gems as if they
were spheres, gaining the same benefit.

Chull
Chulls are large, docile land crustaceans that resemble
enormous hermit crabs with stone-like shells. A full-
grown chull’s shell is over twice the height of most
adults. Despite their slow speed, chulls have been
domesticated since before memory. Their endurance,
strength, and ability to withstand highstorms make
them the most popular mount for extended journeys.
```

```
Horse
Horses are extremely uncommon on Roshar, and
are generally owned by nobles and other high-class,
prosperous individuals.
Ryshadium
Sometimes referred to as “the third Shard” alongside
Shardblades and Plate, Ryshadium are an exceedingly
rare breed of horse. They stand an average of two hands
taller than horses of other breeds, have stone-like hooves
that don’t require horseshoes, and can carry a warrior
wearing Shardplate into battle—a feat which would
injure or kill other horses.
In addition, Ryshadium seem to have a symbiotic
bond with musicspren, and their eyes brim with
intelligence and sapience. A Ryshadium chooses
their rider, refusing others who attempt to ride them.
```

```
Vehicles
Vehicles enable travel over water or allow quicker or
safer travel over land. Almost all vehicles on Roshar
are designed to weather passing highstorms.
The Vehicles table lists common forms of trans-
portation, including the type of vehicle, average travel
speed, and cost to rent or purchase one. The rental rate
grants you temporary use of the vehicle and provides you
the animals or people needed to operate it. If you’d like
to purchase a vehicle, you’ll need to staff it yourself.

Travel

Whether your adventuring party is a task force charged
with missions by the Coalition of Monarchs, a band of
mercenaries that sell your capabilities around Roshar,
an expeditionary group seeking lost knowledge, or
something else entirely, you’re likely to trek far and wide
across Roshar. This section contains information about
lodging, mounts, and vehicles that may be helpful when
you’re far from home.

Lodging

While traveling, you may find yourself wanting a
room, especially during a highstorm. From public
stormshelters to the finest of accommodations, the
Lodging table lists how much it generally costs to stay
per night. You can usually purchase food at or near
these lodgings, using the prices on the Equipment
table in the previous section.

**Lodging**

Mounts

Chulls are the most common mounts on Roshar, but a
privileged few people use horses or Ryshadium instead.
The Mounts table lists each mount’s travel speed and
carrying capacity (representing the pace and weight
the mount could comfortably maintain during a long
expedition).
When attached to a cart, carriage, or other vehicle,
a mount can move five times its carrying capacity
(including the weight of the vehicle). If multiple mounts
are pulling the same vehicle, combine their carrying
capacities.

Fabrials
Fabrials fill many roles in Rosharan societies, whether
in the form of modern conveniences like spanreeds,
ancient relics like Soulcasters, or technological break-
throughs like half-shards. In some regions, fabrials are
quite common, while in other parts of the world, they
are especially rare.
These marvelous Stormlight-powered devices
perform a variety of functions. A simple fabrial might
merely heat a home, while others are priceless artifacts
that transform materials into other materials.
A fabrial is constructed by trapping a spren within
a gemstone; the type of spren determines the fabrial’s
basic function, then the gemstone is surrounded by
complex metal latticeworks to fine-tune its effects.
More complex fabrials contain multiple gems (and
spren trapped within them).
```

```
Activating Fabrials
The gem or gems at the core of a fabrial are usually
charged with Investiture in the form of Stormlight,
which powers the fabrial’s effects. Each fabrial can
hold a certain number of charges (see “Using Items”
at the beginning of this chapter), determined when that
fabrial is crafted. While the fabrial has at least 1 charge,
it is Invested. Like spheres, the fabrial’s gems must be
recharged after their Investiture is expended.
Unless otherwise specified, you can use the Interact
action to activate a fabrial you’re touching. An activated
fabrial expends 1 charge to produce that fabrial’s effect,
which lasts for the duration specified. The fabrial
continues to spend more charges until you touch it as 
 to deactivate it, or until it runs out of charges.
```

```
Unique Fabrials
Beyond the common fabrials in the following section,
many cutting-edge fabrials push the limits of this
technology. Such experimental devices produce effects
that people never dreamed possible through technology.
Some mimic the capabilities of Radiant surges, while
others miniaturize larger fabrials. You can only acquire
a unique fabrial by finding or being gifted one—or in
the case of inventive characters, by crafting your own
(see “Inventing Unique Fabrials” later in this chapter).
```

```
Standard Fabrials
The fabrials on the Standard Fabrials table are regularly
produced or used throughout Roshar. Some are consid-
ered commonplace and even mundane (though they’re
often still expensive). These fabrials can be purchased
and used much like the other items in this chapter.

Alerter (5 charges). While active, an alerter detects
the presence of approaching people or objects, blinking
if they’re within a certain radius. When an alerter is
crafted, the creator sets its radius and can tune it to
detect certain people, certain materials, the use of
certain surges, and similar alerts. An alerter expends
1 charge for each day it’s active.
Attractor (5 charges). Each attractor is attuned
to a particular Essence or material, such as water,
smoke, or another Essence. While activated, the fabrial
weakly attracts the attuned material within a specific
radius. Both the material it attracts and the radius are
determined when the attractor is created. The attractor
pulls its attuned material toward it at a rate of 1 foot
per round, but this has no effect on anything worn or
carried by a character. An attractor expends 1 charge
for each hour it’s active.
Clock Fabrial (3 charges). Larger clock fabrials
can announce the hour when mounted on a building,
while smaller versions can be worn as jewelry to allow
their wearer to know the exact time. Both types spend
1 charge for every 5 days they’re active.
Drainer (2 charges). Drainer fabrials can
partially drain Stormlight from infused gems to alter
the strength of their glow; this is primarily done for
aesthetic purposes. You can use an Interact action to
touch this fabrial to an Invested or infused object or
character. If the fabrial isn’t fully charged, the target
loses 1 Investiture or charge, and this fabrial gains
1 charge. If the target is an unwilling character (or an
object being worn or held by one), you must succeed
on an Agility test against that character’s Physical
defense; on a failure, you don’t drain the target and

The heatrial expends charges based on what
temperature it is set to. For comfortable ambient
heat, it expends 1 charge for each day it is active. For
temperatures high enough for activities like cooking
or blacksmithing, it expends 1 charge for each hour it
is active.
Painrial (amplifying; 3 charges). The amplifying
painrial increases a target’s sense of pain. It is a melee
weapon that uses the Light Weaponry skill and deals 1d6
vital damage. On a hit, you can spend 1 charge to add
your skill modifier to the damage one additional time.
Painrial (numbing; 3 charges). The numbing
painrial decreases the wearer’s sense of pain. Before you
take damage while wearing the painrial, you can use
and spend 1 charge to reduce the damage by 1d4.
Repeller (5 charges). Each repeller is attuned to a
particular Essence or material—such as water, smoke,
or another Essence. While activated, the fabrial weakly
pushes away the attuned material within a specific
radius. Both the material it repels and the radius are
determined when the repeller is created. If the repeller
is heavier, it pushes the attuned material away from
it at a rate of 1 foot per round, until the material is
outside the repeller’s radius. If the material is heavier,
the repeller instead pushes itself away from the

can’t try again for 1 minute. Once this fabrial is fully
charged, it can be emptied by using a tuning fork, by
a Radiant drawing in its Investiture (and regaining
an equal amount of Investiture), or by allowing the
Investiture to fade over the course of 5 days.
Emotion Bracelet (3 charges). Emotion bracelets
blink or change color in the presence of different
emotions. The bracelet’s wearer can spend 1 charge
as to gain an advantage on an Insight test against
a character within 10 feet of them.
Freechair (unlimited charges). Freechairs are
mobility devices that levitate and move by engaging
fabrial components. While freechairs are available
for purchase, disabled characters can obtain one for
free and don’t have to track charges. The operator
of a freechair has the same movement rate as other
char acters (see “Speed” in chapter 3), and it doesn’t
require an action to activate.
Heatrial (5 charges). Commonly known as warm-
ers, heatrials generate heat. You can use an Interact
action to activate the heatrial or to adjust the radius
and intensity of the heat, allowing uses such as gently
warming its surroundings or cooking food. If a character
touches the gemstone while the heatrial is active, they
take 1d6 energy damage.

the Soulcaster to cause one gem to break. A broken
gem must be replaced before the Soulcaster can be used
again; doing so requires several hours of work from
someone with the Fabrial Crafting specialist expertise.
Spanreed (3 charges). Spanreeds come in pairs,
with each reed conjoined to the other, allowing for the
bearers of each to communicate over long distances.
Each spanreed is a writing utensil with an infused ruby
at the top. When one bearer twists the ruby to activate
it, their spanreed causes the paired spanreed’s ruby
to blink, signaling that communication is requested.
When the other spanreed bearer is ready, they twist
their spanreed’s ruby, and the two reeds begin to move
in parallel. By taking turns writing, the bearers can
conduct written conversations. Both spanreeds must
be stationary for them to work, preventing their use
on boats, in carriages, and in similar situations. A pair
of spanreeds expend 1 charge for every 5 days they
are active.
Suppressor (2 charges). Suppressors are special-
ized replications of a much grander construction at the
heart of Urithiru, tower-city of the Knights Radiant.
When activated, this fabrial suppresses the use of surges
in a radius of 30 feet. The suppressor can be charged
with different types of Light, each one affect ing different
Surgebinders: When infused with Stormlight, it stops
users of Voidlight, and when infused with Voidlight,
it stops users of Stormlight. Affected characters in its
radius can’t use surges or summon Radiant Shardblades
or Shardplate. Radiants of the Fourth Ideal or
higher can attempt to push through this suppression,
making a DC 20 test at the start of each round using
the appropriate surge skill (no action required); on a
success, they can use one action from that surge during
that round. A suppressor expends 1 charge for each
hour it is active.
```

```
material. This fabrial can’t affect anything being worn
or carried by a character. A repeller expends 1 charge for
each hour it is active.
Soulcaster (5 charges). Soulcasters mimic the
Radiant surge of Transformation, more commonly
called Soulcasting. However, unlike Radiants, the vast
majority of fabrial Soulcasters can only turn materials
into one Essence. For example, a stone Soulcaster can
turn water, wood, or even air into stone, but it can’t do
the reverse.
When you touch the Soulcaster to an object you want
to transform, then tap one of the three gemstones on the
fabrial, you can activate the Transformation surge (see
chapter 6) using the surge’s normal rules and activation
time, with the following changes:
```

◆ (^) You can spend charges from the Soulcaster in place
of Investiture for the surge.
◆ (^) You don’t need a free hand, but you must hold the
Soulcaster in your hand.
◆ (^) The Soulcaster can only transform material into the
one Essence to which it is linked.
◆ (^) If you have no ranks in Transformation, your
maximum surge size is Small (2.5 feet).
◆ (^) When making a Transformation test, you can use
either your Transformation modifier (if you have that
skill) or your Willpower attribute score (without any
ranks in a skill).
If a non-Radiant character practices with a Soulcaster
long enough, the GM might allow them to invest skill
ranks into Transformation when they gain a level, but
they still need the Soulcaster to use the surge.
Soulcasters contain three gemstones that they need
to function. The vast amounts of Investiture used can
cause them to crack. The GM can spend from using

Step 2: Make a Crafting Test
Once you have all needed materials, it’s time to actually
craft the item during downtime (see “Downtime” in
chapter 9).
Time Spent. When crafting, you can usually
produce 100 marks worth of work in one workday.
For example, a greatsword worth 200 marks requires
2 workdays to complete, while a lockpick worth 5 marks
requires only a fraction of a workday. However, this time
can be modified by Opportunities or Complications
during the crafting process: each Opportunity you roll
during your Crafting test reduces the time to create the
item by 25 percent, while each Complication increases
it by 25 percent.
Crafting Te st. When you’re ready to begin crafting,
roll a Crafting test and raise the stakes. At the GM’s
discretion, you might gain an advantage on this test if
you have exceptional tools or facilities available, or you
might gain a disadvantage if your tools or facilities are
exceptionally poor.
Consult the Item Crafting Test table to determine
how your test result affects your crafting. And if you roll
an Opportunity or Complication, don’t forget to modify
your crafting time as described in “Time Spent.”

Experienced craftspeople can **craft** non-Invested
items for themselves, including weapons, armor,
equipment, and even grander creations like buildings
or works of art.

Crafting Prerequisites

You can only craft an item if you have an expertise
relevant to the item you want to craft. For example, to
craft a sidesword, you need either the Weapon Crafting
expertise or the Sidesword expertise.
If you only have a broad expertise (like Weapon
Crafting), you can craft relevant items with it, but the
item’s user can’t benefit from the expert traits of those
items in combat.

Crafting Mundane Items

If you have the necessary expertise, choose a non-
Invested item with a price from the Weapons table,
Armor table, or Equipment table. At the GM’s
discretion, you can craft a different non-Invested
item instead. Use the following steps to craft your
chosen item:

**1.** Acquire the necessary materials.
**2.** Make a Crafting test.
**3.** Apply any upgrades or drawbacks.

Step 1: Acquire Materials
For non-Invested items, it’s assumed you can easily find
the metal, leather, shalebark, or other raw materials to
craft the item, provided you have access to a common
trade network or other market.
**Material Cost.** The cost to acquire the raw
materials equals half the normal value of the item
you’re crafting.
**To ol s and Facilities.** Additionally, you need access
to the proper tools and facilities to craft the item. This
is up to the GM’s discretion based on the specifics of
the item you’re making. You might be able to fashion a
quick lockpick with just your hands, but a sharp sword
requires access to a forge and anvil. If your tools and
facilities are poor, you might gain a disadvantage on
your Crafting test in step 2.

Chapter 7: Items 265
```

```
Step 3: Apply Upgrades
and Drawbacks
For each upgrade you earned as part of your Crafting
test, choose an upgrade from the Item Upgrades and
Drawbacks table. You’re free to suggest your own
creative ideas if the GM approves. If you earned two
or more upgrades, you can (if you wish) instead choose
from the next section, “Advanced Item Features.”
For each drawback earned, roll a d6 on the same
table to randomly determine a drawback. The GM
may also decide to assign you a creative drawback
in certain situations.
```

```
Item Upgrades and Drawbacks
d6 Upgrade Drawback
1 You salvage enough
materials from the scraps to
make something else. The
item you just crafted has no
material cost.
```

```
The process requires
far more materials than
expected. The item costs
twice as much to create.
```

```
2 If made or sold publicly,
the item’s superior crafts-
manship earns you acclaim
among discerning crafters
and buyers.
```

```
You accidentally damage
your tools or facilities.
Depending on whose
facilities you’re using, this
may cost you marks or hurt
your reputation.
3 Your item is far lighter than
normal. Halve its weight.
```

```
Your item is far bulkier than
normal. Double its weight.
4 The item is sturdy. It ignores
Complication effects
that might cause it to be
damaged or break.
```

```
The item is delicate. A
Complication on any test
using the item causes it
to break.
5 The item is incredibly
beautiful and impresses
everyone who sees it.
```

```
The item is an absolute
eyesore.
```

```
6 Your item has gained you
recognition among scholars
or ardents; you attract the
attention of a potential
patron (see “Rewards” in
chapter 9).
```

```
Your item has made
some scholars or ardents
professionally jealous; this
will impact you in the future.
```

```
Advanced Item Features
In exceptional circumstances, craftspeople can generate
up to three upgrades during the crafting process. When
this happens, you can choose to spend two upgrades
to apply one feature of your choice from the Advanced
Item Features table, instead of choosing from the Item
Upgrades and Drawbacks results table.
```

```
Advanced Item Features
Feature Name Effect
Adorned If the item is armor, it gains Presentable
as an expert trait thanks to the artistic
flourishes you add.
Hidden
Compartment
```

```
The item has a storage compartment
that can contain another object up to
one-quarter of the item’s volume.
Lethal Design If the item is a weapon, when a character
makes an injury roll due to this weapon,
subtract 3 from the result.
Perfect Balance If the item has the Cumbersome
trait, reduce the value of that trait by
```

combine existing effects in innovative ways, while
others even replicate the effects of Surgebinders. An
enterprising character can attempt to create such a
device, but inventing these unique fabrials follows
special rules beyond crafting basic items.
In general, unique fabrials are only available
to characters selecting talents from the Scholar
(Artifabrian) path, or to characters who earn special
gemstones as rewards (see “Fabrials and High-Quality
Gems” in chapter 8).
Use the following steps to craft your chosen fabrial:
```

**1.** Choose your desired effect.
**2.** Acquire the necessary materials.
**3.** Trap a spren.
**4.** Make a Crafting test.
**5.** Apply any upgrades or drawbacks.
Step 1: Choose Your Effect
To invent a unique fabrial, first you must decide what
you want it to accomplish. You can choose a fabrial
effect from those listed on the Unique Fabrial Effects
table later in this section (provided your chosen effect
is of an equal or lower tier than the gemstone you’ll use
to craft it). Each effect lists the total number of charges
that fabrial will have, along with its tier that affects the
expense and difficulty of crafting the device.
Enterprising players may instead suggest new effects
of their own creation, and adventurous GMs are
encouraged to work with them to find something that
feels balanced.
Any unique fabrials you craft follow the standard
fabrial rules (see “Fabrials” earlier in this chapter).

```
Step 2: Acquire Materials
Much like crafting other items, it’s assumed you can
acquire most of the raw materials you need for the fab-
rial. The cost of these materials depends on the tier of
effect you chose from the Unique Fabrial Effects table:
```

◆ (^) **Tier 1:** 100 marks
◆ (^) **Tier 2:** 200 marks
◆ (^) **Tier 3:** 400 marks
◆ (^) **Tier 4:** 800 marks
This material cost includes any rare metals, but it
doesn’t include one key component: the gemstone.
Crafting Standard Fabrials
While the methods of creating certain fabrials have
been lost to time (see the “Dead Spren” sidebar),
most modern-day fabrials can be created by crafters
with sufficient research and finesse. The process
requires much more specialized knowledge and precise
handiwork than crafting a mundane item, but otherwise
follows similar steps.
Each fabrial requires a gemstone specifically cut for
that purpose, surrounded by a delicate latticework of
metal and other materials to tune the device’s function.
But even more important is what’s housed within that
gemstone. Part of the process of crafting a fabrial
involves luring a spren of a specific type and trapping
it within the gem. This spren provides the fabrial with
its functionality, and it must be lured with something
that appeals to its unique nature.
Fabrial Crafting Steps
You can craft any standard fabrial with a price listed
on the Standard Fabrials table earlier in this chapter.
Doing so follows the standard crafting rules in the
previous “Crafting Mundane Items” section, but you
must have an expertise in Fabrial Crafting or in the
specific fabrial you’re creating.
Though standard fabrials require gems, these are
easily acquired as part of the materials you purchase in
step 1 of the crafting process. Similarly, the process for
attracting a spren and crafting a standard fabrial is well
documented, so you don’t need to make an additional
test to trap the spren. (However, as described in the next
section, crafting unique fabrials does require special
materials and an additional test.)
Fabrial Upgrades
As with crafting other items, if your fabrial’s
Crafting test yields two upgrades, you can use
those to choose one advanced feature. When you
do, you can either choose from the earlier “Advanced
Item Features” section, or you can choose from the
upcoming “Advanced Fabrial Features” subsection
of “Inventing Unique Fabrials.”
Inventing Unique Fabrials
Cutting-edge artifabrians often devote their efforts
to experimenting with fabrials that are unheard of
or that only exist in cloistered laboratories as proto-
types. Some of these experimental technologies
Chapter 7: Items **267**

```
Fabrial Gem
The gemstone required for these cutting-edge fabrials
is far more specialized than the ones needed for a
spanreed. This is no common gem from a mark or
broam, but a large gem specially cut for this purpose.
These gems are incredibly rare items that can’t simply
be bought at a market. Instead, acquiring a gem capable
of making a unique fabrial is a task worthy of one of
your character’s goals (see chapter 8). Through your
adventures, you may be able to acquire such a gem from
a wealthy patron. You might even cut your own after
pulling it from the heart of a chasmfiend, but you can’t
obtain it from your local merchant.
Your gem can only be used to craft a fabrial of that
gem’s tier or lower (as shown on the Unique Fabrial
Effects table). Most gems earned as rewards are of the
same tier as your current character, though this is at
the GM’s discretion.
Each gem can be used to create a single unique
fabrial. Once used, the gem can’t be repurposed.
```

```
Step 3: Trap a Spren
Before you can build the device around the gemstone,
your fabrial requires one other delicate step: luring and
trapping the spren. This can be a tricky process that
requires multiple attempts. Each attempt at luring a
spren requires 1 day of downtime activity (see “Down-
time” in chapter 9).
To trap a spren, you need the gem that can trap it,
specific knowledge of the spren you’re seeking, and
knowledge of what attracts that spren and enraptures
it long enough for you to capture it. When you have
these things and are ready to trap a spren, make a Lore
test, with a DC determined by the tier of the effect you
chose from the Unique Fabrial Effects table:
```

◆ (^) **Tier 1:** DC 15
◆ (^) **Tier 2:** DC 20
◆ (^) **Tier 3:** DC 25
◆ (^) **Tier 4:** DC 30
If you succeed, you capture the spren and proceed to
the next step. If you fail, you must reattempt capturing
the spren on another day, continuing until you succeed
or give up.
**Dead Spren**
Some of the most powerful items throughout Roshar—
such as Soulcasters, Shardplate, and Shardblades—were
created not by technology, but by the sacrifice of ancient
spren. Though these items are presented alongside the
other weapons or fabrials in their corresponding sections,
they are far more exceptional, and their methods of
crafting have been lost to time. Such legendary items can’t
simply be purchased or crafted; instead, characters must
earn them as rewards (see chapter 8).
**Fabrial Metals**
When crafting fabrials, you don’t need to worry about
the details of which metals you use and how you craft
them. However, you might like to enhance the stories
you tell about your fabrials and how they function (or
malfunction). If so, it’s good to know that each metal
has a different effect on spren and fabrial functionality,
as follows:
◆ (^) **Aluminum** can block the connection between spren,
affecting how conjoined spren interact or how spren
react to sentient thoughts.
◆ (^) **Brass** can dim the intensity of a spren’s manifestation.
◆ (^) **Bronze** can improve a spren’s ability to detect rhythms
or receive thoughts.
◆ (^) **Copper** can allow a fabrial to conduct energy or
transmit thoughts.
◆ (^) **Iron** can attract certain substances or adjust a
fabrial’s polarity.
◆ (^) **Pewter** can cause the fabrial to augment an attribute
or energy source.
◆ (^) **Steel** can repel certain substances or adjust a
fabrial’s polarity.
◆ (^) **Tin** can cause the fabrial to diminish an attribute or
energy source.
◆ (^) **Zinc** can increase the intensity of a spren’s
manifestation.

FLORIAN STITZ

Step 4: Make a Crafting Test
Once you capture the spren, you can make and resolve
a crafting test. This takes one day of downtime per tier
of fabrial you’re trying to create. However, this time can
be modified by Opportunities or Complications during
the crafting process: each Opportunity you roll during
your Crafting test reduces the time to create the item
by 25 percent, while each Complication increases it by
25 percent.
Make a Crafting test and raise the stakes. Consult the
Fabrial Crafting Test table to determine how your test
result affects your crafting.

Step 5: Apply Upgrades 
and Drawbacks
For each upgrade you earned as part of your Crafting
test, choose an upgrade listed next to your chosen fabrial
effect (from the “Unique Fabrial Effects” section) or
any qualifying upgrade from the Fabrial Upgrades and
Drawbacks table. If you earned two upgrades, you can
instead choose (if you wish) from the “Advanced Fabrial
Features” section.
For each drawback you earned, you can choose the
drawback listed next to your chosen fabrial, or you can
roll a d8 on the Fabrial Upgrades and Drawbacks table

```
to randomly determine a drawback (rerolling if the listed
requirement doesn’t match your fabrial). The GM may
also decide to assign you a creative drawback or
come up with another creative idea for one of your
Complications.

Surge Fabrial
Tier 4 Unique Fabrial Effect
You’ve discovered how to create a fabrial that can mimic
Radiant surgebinding. When you craft this fabrial,
choose one Radiant surge. You can use this fabrial to
activate that surge, using the surge’s normal rules and
activation time, with the following changes:
```

◆ (^) You can spend charges from this fabrial in place of
Investiture for the surge.
◆ (^) If you have no ranks in the corresponding surge skill,
consider yourself to have 1 rank for the purpose of
determining effects.
◆ (^) When making a test, you can use the corresponding
surge skill (if you have that skill) or your Willpower
attribute score (without any ranks in a skill).
If your non-Radiant character practices with this fabrial
long enough, the GM might allow you to invest skill
ranks into the corresponding skill when you gain a level,
but you can’t use that skill without this fabrial.
**Charges.** This fabrial has 4 charges.
**Drawback.** Only you can use this fabrial.
**Upgrade.** If you practice with this fabrial, you can
choose talents from the corresponding surge’s talent
tree when you gain a level. You can’t use those talents
without this fabrial, but can replace them using
the Self-Reflection downtime activity described

Purpose
You r purpose is your core need. You can’t help but
act on and embody it, and if you nurture your purpose,
it can become your greatest strength. What’s the
most important and instinctual thing you want to do
with your life? Save people? Exact justice? Make an
important discovery?
Choose a purpose that’s an ongoing driving force in
your life, not a concrete achievable goal. This is intrinsic
to your character, unchanging unless your character
goes through a major crisis or epiphany. Your character
is likely unaware of this purpose, but you (as the player)
know it, and you can use that information to inform
many of your decisions.
You can choose any purpose you wish, but remember
you’re telling a collaborative story with others. The
story will come together more smoothly if your char-
acter is motivated to pursue adventure and stick with
their team.
Example Purposes
Here are a few examples of purposes that can drive your
adventures on Roshar:
Save Others. You have an unrelenting need to defend
those who can’t protect themselves.
Seek Truth. You’re driven by an innate curiosity that
can be slaked but never fully quenched.
Push Yourself to New Heights. You desire to discover
and surpass your own physical or mental limits.
Find Connection. You define yourself by your
connections with others, and you’re intentional about
seeking others to care for and surround yourself with.
Seek Justice. Injustice is intolerable in your eyes, and
you aspire to see those who take advantage of others
properly rebuked.
Preserve Life. You believe all life has intrinsic value,
and you act to preserve as much as possible.

## Goals and Rewards

# AA

```
s your character adventures across
Roshar, you grow not only by gaining levels
(see “Character Advancement” in chapter 1),
but by completing personal goals. In so doing, you earn
rewards that grant you powerful items, relationships,
or abilities.
Though the whole party might be working toward a
broader objective, each goal and its subsequent reward
is personal to you and your story. One character might
be working toward earning a Shardblade in a duel—
preferably against their fiercest rival. Another character
might be a Radiant trying to find the Words to swear the
Third Ideal of their order. Yet another might be trying
to earn the favor of the mysterious Thaidakar, head of
the Ghostbloods.
```

```
Purpose and Obstacle
While you may pursue many different goals across your
adventures, there’s always a driving force that pushes
you forward and a force that you struggle against. These
forces are represented by your purpose that drives and
motivates your actions, as well as your obstacle that you
struggle against.
For some people, purpose and obstacle are two sides
of the same coin. Consider who you are at your best:
now what happens if that aspect is pushed too far?
Perhaps you’re driven to save others, but in the process,
you ignore your own needs and burn out quickly. Or
perhaps your pursuit of truth leads you to disdain those
who see the world differently from you.
Your purpose and obstacle don’t directly lead
to rewards. However, they’re foundational to your
personality, helping guide you in choosing what goals
you want to pursue—which in turn unlock powerful
rewards. When you choose your purpose and obstacle
during step 7 of character creation, consider the
following guidance.
```

```
“Today, you and your men sacrificed to
buy me twenty-six hundred priceless lives.
And all I had to repay you with was a single
priceless sword. I call that a bargain.”
```

Obstacle
An obstacle persistently gets in the way of fulfilling
your purpose or pursuing your goals. This can be a
lifelong trait or something that emerged from your past;
either way, your struggle with it is an important part of
your life. What obstacle keeps you from reaching your
full potential? Are you impulsive? Greedy? Do you fixate
on your mistakes?
Like your purpose, your obstacle is immutable.
It doesn’t define you, and you may gradually learn
to compensate for it and nurture new strengths in the
process—but it’ll always influence you to some degree.
Since this obstacle will be a huge part of your character’s
journey, it should be something that you (as the player)
are eager to explore throughout the duration of the game.
At times, your character may show lots of improvement,
then mess up. Personal growth isn’t linear. Regressions,
self-doubt, lapses in judgment, and renewed hope are
ingredients for compelling storytelling.
```

```
Example Obstacles
Here are a few examples of obstacles that can challenge
you during your adventures:
Deep Regret. You’ve done something that weighs heavily
on you. Perhaps you wish you could change it, or
perhaps it simply eats away at your conscience when
your mind is unoccupied.
Specific Fear. You have a particular fear that returns
unbidden, no matter what you achieve.
Spite. You tend to hold petty grudges and communicate
defensively. At times, your volatile temper causes you
to act impulsively.
Self-Doubt. You have trouble believing in yourself,
and you often seek retreat in situations where you
stand out.
Mistrust of Others. You have trouble relying on other
people. In the past, you’ve pushed others away to avoid
the risk of being disappointed or betrayed by them.
```

```
Goals
Once you know your character’s purpose and obstacle,
these can help inform the goals you pursue. In this
game, goals serve two purposes: First, they’re concrete
objectives your character wants to achieve. Second,
they’re a means of tracking character development over
the course of a story as your character pursues that goal.
You start with one or two goals and can attain more
during play. On your character sheet, each goal includes
```

```
Using Purposes and Obstacles
Purposes and obstacles don’t have specific rules, but
they’re fundamental to who your character is. As you face
different challenges throughout the game, your character
will be tested. What you as the player see as the “optimal”
approach is often exactly the opposite of what your char-
acter’s purpose may drive them to do, or your approach
might be blocked by their obstacle.
In these moments, try to play to your character:
embrace the suboptimal choice to be truer to who they
are. In these cases, the GM will often reward you with
raising the stakes for playing true to your character in
a critical moment.

```

three **milestone boxes** , representing your progress
toward completing it. It’s up to you and your GM to
decide together on what achieving each goal looks like.
When you conclude a goal, you receive a reward (see
“Rewards” later in this chapter). Concluding a goal can
mean achieving it, but it can also mean growing past the
goal, discovering something that replaces it with a new
goal, or achieving something else that your character
realizes is more important to them.

Creating Goals

You can add a new goal to your character anytime
you take on a new opportunity for personal growth or
accomplishment. The GM might suggest a new goal for
you, you might decide on a new goal yourself, or a talent
or other effect might grant you a new goal. When this
happens (including at character creation), work with the
GM to craft the goal and consider the questions below:

**Character’s Goal.** How does your character understand
this goal?
**Player’s Goal.** What do I, the player, want to see my
character do, learn, or experience by undertaking
this goal?
**Advancing Your Goal.** What are a few concrete ways
this goal can be advanced?

Before deciding on a goal (see “Example Goals” below),
discuss it with the GM to ensure it’s a good fit for your
campaign’s shared story. Once you and the GM agree,
record the goal on the back of your character sheet;
additionally, your GM should record it in their notes,
along with any suggestions you have for how the goal
might be fulfilled.
As a campaign progresses, you might conclude your
existing goals, thus going without a goal for a short time
(if it makes sense within the story). However, always
plan to replace your goal without too long a gap.
Though most characters actively work toward their
goals, it’s possible your character isn’t consciously aware
of or willing to admit to theirs; for example, perhaps
they’re close to swearing the First Ideal but don’t realize
it. You may even wish to tell a tragic story of someone
who never realizes their full potential and gets bogged
down by increasingly terrible decisions—though it’s
prudent to consider whether playing this will be a
satisfying trajectory for you (and your fellow players).
If you choose a goal that you think your character
won’t ever reach, see “Concluding Goals” for guidance
on how to resolve that tension.

```
Example Goals
Here are a few examples of goals with concrete ways to
advance them:
Become a Noble. You aspire to the wealth and power
of the noble houses of Roshar. You’re determined to
join their ranks.
Find a Missing Person. You’re looking for someone
you once knew, desperate to recover them.
Fulfill a Specific Oath. You’ve sworn to achieve a
particular objective, and you place a great deal of
importance on your success.
Repay a Debt of Gratitude. You feel a great
responsibility to another person or a group, and
you desire to repay their past benevolence.
Get Revenge. You’re seeking vengeance against a
specific person for some past misdeed.
```

```
Advancing Goals
When your character makes decisions that help advance
your goal, the GM will tell you to add a milestone
to the goal (putting a checkmark next to it on your
character sheet).
You can usually advance each of your goals roughly
once per game session. On particularly momentous
occasions, the GM may have you advance a goal twice.
At the end of each game session, if you didn’t put a
check next to a goal during the session, consider whether
your character did anything to advance the goal; if so,
discuss it with the GM. You can also use downtime to
pursue goals (see “Downtime” in chapter 9).
```

```
Making the Most of
Goals as a Player
From a player’s perspective, goals are a useful tool
for telling your GM the sorts of stories you want your
character to participate in. Goals are also a way to track
your character’s progress over the course of a story.
Try to take the initiative on pursuing goals. If you
see a chance to pursue one of your goals, ask the GM
about it—but remember to share the spotlight with other
players. If your character knows another character’s
goal, you might even help them pursue it.
Finally, each time you check a milestone, consider
recording what happened in the “Notes” section of your
character sheet, allowing you to look back on your char-
acter’s story arc when you eventually conclude the goal.
You probably won’t progress every goal every session,
but if you notice you haven’t progressed a particular goal
for several sessions, talk to the GM about how it can be
integrated into the story moving forward or reworked to
better fit the ongoing narrative.
```

```
Chapter 8: Goals and Rewards 277
```

```
a reward (see the upcoming “Rewards” section) and
move on to other goals. This is your chance to enjoy
the dramatic payout that’s been building while you
progressed your goal milestones.
Both you and the GM should have input on how the
goal concludes within the story, based on the milestones
you have achieved along the way. If the conclusion of
the goal is mostly internal to your character, you might
have more say over it, while if it significantly impacts
the game world, the GM might have more say. Either
way, this should always be a conversation between both
parties, though the GM decides how to resolve any
uncertainties.
Concluding a goal doesn’t necessarily mean you
achieved it within the narrative. Rather than concluding
a goal through success, you might instead grow as a
character or even conclude it through failure.
Conclusion Through Success
The most straightforward way to conclude a goal is
by achieving it within the narrative. You did what you
set out to do. Perhaps you got revenge, redeemed your
tarnished reputation, or saved the family farm. Whatever
the case, enjoy a moment of respite, celebrate victory,
or at least find some sense of closure. Tomorrow, you’ll
have to answer the hard question of “what next?”
```

```
Conclusion Through Growth
Success isn’t always the most narratively satisfying way
to conclude a goal. You might’ve intentionally picked an
impossible goal for your character to explore in the story,
or you might decide that succeeding isn’t the best thing
for your character now. Your character might grow past
a goal they realize is unhealthy or untenable. Or they
might determine the goal was a manifestation of another
motivation they didn’t fully understand yet. Coming
to these poignant realizations can be just as dramatic
as actually succeeding, and this certainly can count
as fulfilling a goal.
Conclusion Through Failure
Perhaps counterintuitively, your character can also
conclude a goal by failing at it. Across Roshar and our
world alike, people sometimes fail in their aspirations—
but failure can also be a great teacher and an important
motivator. Failing definitively in a goal might help shape
your next goal, focus your character’s personal growth,
or otherwise shape them just as much as success.
Consider how your character might grow in the face
of failure, and what new goal they might choose now.
```

```
Making the Most of Goals as a GM
From a GM’s perspective, goals are signals from your
players about what they want their characters to do in
the story. During each session, try to give each character
at least one opportunity to pursue one of their goals.
You can advance goals during or after sessions. The
end of each game session is a good time to consider what
the characters did this session. If any moments relating
to a character’s goal stand out to you, tell that player to
advance the goal and let them know why.
```

```
Suggesting Goals
As the GM, you might have ideas about new goals for
characters—feel free to suggest these to that character’s
player. Especially when a character has no goal (due to
completing a previous one), this can help begin a new
narrative arc and encourage the character to grow in
certain directions. For instance, after saving a powerful
noble’s life, you can offer them a goal to gain that noble’s
trust and protection as a patron (see “Rewards” later in
this chapter).
If a player doesn’t want a goal you offer, that’s okay.
They can use it as inspiration for a different goal or
suggest something of their own creation. A player
ultimately controls which goals their character takes on
(if any), but feel free to encourage them as the GM.
```

```
Concluding Goals
When one of your goals reaches three milestones
(denoted with checkmarks), you can inform the GM
(either in that session or between sessions) that you want
to conclude that goal. You don’t have to conclude a goal
immediately upon receiving your third checkmark—feel
free to ask the GM to wait for a more dramatically
appropriate moment.
After you inform the GM that you want to
conclude a goal, discuss with them how your character
will conclude the goal within the story. This is a
collaborative effort that should provide a climax for your
character arc. Once a goal is concluded, you’ll receive
```

```
Radiant Ideal Goals
To advance in a Radiant order by swearing one of its
Ideals, you must complete a goal (see “Swearing Ideals”
in chapter 5). Unlike other goals, these aren’t granted by
the GM, but by a talent you choose. Once you complete an
Ideal goal, you gain the powerful abilities of that talent and
the potential for future progression in your Radiant order.
```

**278** Chapter 8: Goals and Rewards

Rewards

**Rewards** are major boons that a character receives
within the story. These can vary wildly: some rewards
are material gifts, while others grant patrons, allies, or
even new Radiant abilities. Rewards can be granted
through concluding goals, as discussed earlier in this
chapter, but the GM can also give them when a specific
narrative event would logically result in that reward.

Goal Rewards

When you conclude a goal, you gain a reward based on
what you did while working toward it. In some cases,
the reward you receive is obvious; if the goal was to
swear an Ideal of the Knights Radiant, your reward is
speaking the Words and gaining new abilities from your
Ideal talent.
Sometimes the reward is only abstractly connected
to the conclusion of the goal. For example, if your goal
was to win back a legendary Shardblade one of your
ancestors lost in a duel, you might find your character
conflicted when they learn the truth behind Shard-
blades. If it no longer makes sense for your character to
accept the Blade, you don’t lose your chance at a reward;
rather, at the conclusion of your goal, you might instead
gain a powerful patron who was impressed with your
performance.
In other cases, a goal might not have an obvious
corresponding reward. Solving a mystery or achieving
personal growth might not come with any material
compensation, but the GM can use those moments in
the story to introduce a reward that’s meaningful to your
character.
Even when a reward differs from what your character
expected, it should let you highlight your character’s
development and create opportunities to pursue
further goals.

```
GM Tip: When to Conclude a Goal
If you’re GMing and one of your players wants to conclude
a goal during an active game session, consider whether the
goal should be completed this session or if you need more
time to work a suitable dramatic moment into the natural
flow of the story. In the latter case, make concluding the
goal a priority for the next session. Sometimes, it’s most
dramatically satisfying to conclude a goal on the spot,
while other times, it might prove too disruptive to the
current story. As always, exercise your best judgment on
this, and don’t feel bound to wait or to rush things.
```

```
Spontaneous Rewards
At the GM’s discretion, they might sometimes grant
a spontaneous reward when it makes sense within the
story. For instance, duels in Alethkar typically have
stakes (such as a wager of Shards), with the winner
taking all. If you win such a duel, you might find
yourself in possession of a Shardblade or Shardplate
without needing to conclude a goal.
However, if the GM knows in advance that you want
to win a Shard in a duel, they might want to work with
you to set a goal with multiple steps (such as finding an
opponent, goading that foe into accepting a risky wager,
then winning the actual duel).
```

```
Connections
Many rewards take the form of a connection with
another being—a loyal companion, a helpful patron,
or even a spren with whom you have a deep spiritual
bond. You can record each of these rewards in the
“Connections” section of your character sheet, along
with any other meaningful connections you make with
other characters during your adventures.
```

```
GM Tip: Offering Meaningful Rewards
Sometimes it’s obvious what reward a player wants their
character to earn, and they might’ve already discussed it
with you. In these cases, offering one reward is fine.
Other times, you might want to surprise a player with
a reward. Unless you’re certain a player will be delighted
with the reward, offer reward options from two different
categories. This ensures the player has input on the
rewards their character earns, but still gives you the
chance to offer an unexpected reward.
The more often characters receive spontaneous
rewards (or expect to receive them), the less motivated
some players may be to pursue goals. If you know a player
wants a certain reward, you might encourage them to set
a goal related to it.
```

```
“You see the Connections all people
have: to others, to spren, to time
and reality itself. Everything is
Connected, Dalinar, by a vast
web of interactions, passions,
thoughts, fates.”
```

```
Chapter 8: Goals and Rewards 279
```

Reward Categories

A reward can take nearly any form the GM and players
choose, but most fall into one of the following categories.
Each category suggests recommended character tiers for
various rewards.

Companions

**Companions** are NPCs within the story who are
dedicated to your character in some way. They still have
their own lives and agendas within the world, but they
generally act to assist your character in whatever way
makes sense for them. Depending on the individual, a

```
companion’s loyalty might range from undertaking small
tasks or obtaining information to risking their life on
your behalf. A companion can be a person, an animal,
or at the GM’s discretion, some other character. If a
companion is a human, singer, or other sapient being,
they should be a peer, ally, contact, or other individual
who has a balanced relationship with your character.
Companion Activities
A companion might travel with you if that makes
sense, but they might also live in a particular place
and simply make themself available when you reach
out for help. Companions generally take the initiative
to assist you when appropriate, but this help can take
many forms, from direct assisting you to sending letters
with important information to acquiring supplies
on your behalf. For example, a bodyguard or scribe
might usually stay by your side to provide assistance,
while an undercover agent might operate far from
you, only sending vital information as they receive it.
A companion whose bond to you is driven more by
your relationship than by their employment (a friend,
a romantic interest, a rival) might pursue their own
agenda most of the time, then occasionally meet with
and assist you when narratively suitable.
```

```
Companions in Scenes
Both in combat and in other scenes, the GM controls
all companions, though the companions are inclined
to listen to you if doing so doesn’t conflict with more
fundamental objectives (such as survival). When you
need statistics for a companion, work with your GM to
choose a suitable NPC profile from either this book’s
“Animal Companions” appendix or from chapter 8 in
the Stormlight World Guide.
The Example Companions by Tier table suggests
NPC statistics the GM could use for various character
tiers, including the companion’s suggested role (see
“Building Combat Scenes” in chapter 13), example
profiles, and bonuses they might gain as the party
gains levels. Profiles available in this book’s “Animal
Companions” appendix are marked with an asterisk (*);
the other profiles are found in chapter 8 of the Stormlight
World Guide.
Multiple Companions. At higher tiers, you can
potentially have more than one companion at a time,
as suggested alongside the NPC type in the “Role and
Number” column.
Development Bonuses. If any of your companions
are of a lower tier than you, their statistics increase.
Apply the bonuses listed in the “Development Bonuses”
column of the table. This applies not only to new
companions you gain, but to existing ones.
ANTTI HAKOSAARI
```

For example, if your companion is a tier 1 Minion but
you’ve just leveled up to tier 2, grant them the Minion
bonus listed in the Tier 2 row of the table.

Example Companion: Bodyguard
Fighting skills are difficult to acquire, and you might
be better suited to rely on a protector in physical
confrontations. Even among the martially trained,
bodyguards provide added protection and vigilance
against danger.
**Profile.** At tier 2, a typical bodyguard might use
the  **guard** stat block.

Example Companion: Guide
A guide has specialized knowledge or expertise that you
lack, especially about a region or obscure topic. This
companion might not travel with the party all the time,
instead appearing when you need help working through
a problem that fits the companion’s skills.
**Profile.** At tier 1, a typical guide might use the
**expert** stat block.

Example Companion: Scribe
In some regions (such as Alethkar), literacy is a special-
ized skill, and not everyone can read for themself. To
advance in society, however, it’s crucial to have access
to someone who can read and write. Your scribe might
be a close friend, an employee, or a family member—
someone you trust. After all, you’re putting your ability
to communicate with the wider world into your scribe’s
hands, trusting them to accurately relay the details.
**Profile.** At tier 1, a typical scribe might use the
**expert** stat block.

Example Companion: Animal
Riding and pack animals are common across many
societies of Roshar, from rare creatures like nimble
horses to more common animals like plodding chulls.
These animals can be indispensable, providing transport
and raw strength.

```
Many other animals make excellent companions as
well—some due to their practical abilities, and others
simply for their faithful companionship.
Profile. The “Animal Companions” appendix
provides profiles for several animal companions, along
with guidance for customizing your own. At tier 1,
a typical beast of burden might be a chull (see t he
“Animal Companions” appendix) pulling a wagon.
At tier 2, a character might even be able to earn the trust
of a Ryshadium steed (see chapter 8 of the Stormlight
World Guide ).
```

```
Fabrials and
High-Quality Gems
As described in chapter 7, fabrials are wondrous
mechanisms created with gemstones and powered
with Stormlight. The Example Fabrial Rewards table
suggests suitable gem and fabrial rewards for characters
of each tier. (See chapter 7 for fabrial statistics and rules
for using gems to craft them).
```

```
Unique Fabrials as Rewards
For unique fabrials granted as rewards, the GM might
give you a complete fabrial, or they might let you choose
the effect and any upgrades while they select any draw-
backs. At the GM’s discretion, they might also adjust the
number of these drawbacks and upgrades.
Gems as Rewards
Gemstones of the quality needed to create fabrials
are rare acquisitions in their own right. Instead of a
complete fabrial, the GM might offer such a gem as a
reward, especially if you wish to do your own fabrial
crafting. GMs typically award a gem of a tier matching
your own, though it’s up to what fits the story.

Ideals
To gain Radiant powers, you must attract the attention
of a spren and ultimately speak the Words of your
Radiant order, affirming your alignment with the order’s
Ideals. As described in chapter 5, you advance through
the ranks of your order by completing goals to swear
each Ideal.
When you choose the First Ideal key talent from a
Radiant path, you immediately gain a goal: “Speak the
First Ideal.” Unlike other goals, you can’t set a goal to
speak an Ideal except by choosing a talent that gives
you that goal.
When you complete an Ideal goal by speaking the
Words for your Radiant order, you immediately gain the
reward listed in that talent. Additionally, once you swear
an Ideal, you meet the prerequisites for future talents
that require that Ideal.
```

```
Patrons
Patrons are NPCs within the story who rely on you
and, in turn, provide you with material support, guid-
ance, and resources to carry out your tasks. A patron
generally has access to resources you don’t, whether
these be weapons, wealth, information, influence,
or other assets.
```

```
Patron Expectations
The support of a patron also carries with it an
expectation that you deliver results. For instance, if a
highprince puts their authority behind your efforts to
expose a spy among their subordinates, they expect you
to expose the spy before more sensitive information can
be leaked. If you fail to do so, the highprince will expect
you to explain yourself, proving you’re not incompetent
or unworthy of further support. After repeated failures,
a highprince might reassign you to a less desirable task.
Your patron generally allows you access to their
resources as long as you’re pursuing objectives that
align with your patron’s own. As your character’s tier
increases, your patron becomes willing to extend more
resources to you.

Example Patron: Knight Radiant
The Knights Radiant are mythic warriors of Roshar,
and in this era of uncertainty and devastating storms,
their return is another sign of the coming turmoil. If
you overcome your trepidation and stand alongside
a member of the Radiant orders, you might become
a close ally to this champion. And sometimes, those
close to a Knight Radiant begin to display signs of their
power: mysterious luminescence, miraculous recovery
from injury, and more specialized abilities still. In
becoming the squire of a Radiant, you take your first
step down an ancient path. As an aspirant, you must
begin to grapple with the Ideals of your order even as
you learn to control your new abilities.
Bonded Squire. After spending a month or longer
with your patron, you become a squire to this Knight
Radiant (see “Squires” in chapter 5).
```

```
Example Patron: Wealthy Trader
The power of currency is a force to be reckoned with
on any world, including Roshar. From the Thaylen
merchants who journey on great ships to the foremost
traders of the Reshi Isles, there are many influential
people whose main source of worldly power is robust
finances, shrewd acumen, or both. However, the
backing of such an individual typically comes with an
expectation of returns, whether these take the form of
profits, valuable connections in new places, or political
influence that can be leveraged for future trade deals.
Economic Backing. In addition to the amenities,
the trader is willing to invest in your ventures. Whenever
one or more player characters undertake a plan with the
trader’s permission that supports their goals, the trader
gives the group an operations budget to make necessary
purchases, secure services, and more, as listed on the
Economic Backing table. If multiple characters in the
group have the same patron, the group receives the
operations budget only once.

The more powerful a patron, the more impressive
the support they can offer—but if you haven’t yet proven
your competency, even the most powerful of highprinces
might not trust you with significant resources.

Patron Benefits
If you gain a patron as a reward, they generally provide
two benefits. Each patron grants a specific bonus, as
described in their entry. Additionally, when you’re in a
situation where the patron or their agents have influence,
they might also grant you and your companions travel
amenities (see “Travel” in chapter 7), as listed on the
Patron Amenities by Tier table. However, you won’t
always have access to these amenities, just in situations
where your patron deems it feasible and appropriate.
This section presents three examples of patrons, but
you can find many more in chapter 5 of the _Stormlight
World Guide_.

Example Patron: Alethi Highprince
As the most powerful of the warlords who rule over
Alethkar, highprinces have resources few citizens can
imagine. With a highprince’s backing, there are few
ambitions you can’t pursue.

amenities, the highprince’s authority extends in part to
you. In places where they have political sway, you can
invoke their patronage to gain an advantage on various
tests, as listed by tier on the Highprince Authority table.
However, when you add these advantages to a test,
the GM can spend a Complication to have your use
of the patron’s name raise other challenges—such as
attracting the attention of their many powerful enemies.

Shards as Rewards
Attaining a single Shard is a worthy goal that might take
numerous game sessions to complete, and acquiring
both Plate and Blade could be the work of campaign.
The Shards by Tier table suggests a minimum tier for
each Shard reward.
Shardblades and Shardplate are detailed in the
“Weapons” and “Armor” sections of chapter 7.
```

Titles
Across different Rosharan societies, various titles of
rank or nobility can be granted as a reward for deeds.
In many societies, titles carry with them political
privileges and responsibilities, property and estates,
or even formal positions in a military or government.
The Titles by Tier table provides examples of titles and
their benefits.
The authority and expansiveness of a title depends
on its specifics and its sphere of influence. For instance,
a character who is given a military command would
have very different resources from one who is running
a criminal group, but both would have subordinates,
holdings, and responsibilities they’re expected to attend
to by both their superiors and underlings.
Additionally, at the GM’s discretion, certain titles
can grant an appropriate utility or cultural expertise.
A spymaster might gain an expertise in secret codes,
while a researcher might gain one in a rare kind
of fabrials.
```

```
Example Title: Captain
A leader of a military unit in Alethkar typically leads
a platoon of fifty troops. This role calls for maintaining
order and morale within the unit, keeping the unit in
fighting shape, and training the unit in new techniques
of battle. An effective captain can expect the trust and
obedience of their troops in the field.
Loyal Cadre. You have fifty soldiers under your
command, though they’re generally too busy with their
day-to-day responsibilities to assist you personally (you
can find allies likely to accompany you in the earlier
```

```
Shards
Through the history of Roshar, Shards have been one
of the greatest symbols and manifestations of power.
Once clad in Shardplate and wielding a Shardblade,
a mortal warrior strides the battlefield like a great
hero of myth. A single soldier with Plate and Blade
can devastate enemy formations, singlehandedly
crack hardened positions like fortresses, or hold
off insurmountable odds—so the best way to kill
a Shardbearer on the battlefield is with another
Shardbearer.
The Ryshadium steed, a legendary breed of horse
mighty enough to carry an armored Shardbearer,
is sometimes called the “third Shard.” For giving a
Ryshadium as a reward, see the earlier “Compan-
ions” section.
```

```
Ways of Winning Shards
In addition to functioning as incredible military assets,
Shardblades and Shardplate are exceptionally rare.
They can’t be purchased with currency alone, though
they’re sometimes exchanged to help seal political
alliances (such as marriages), to repay personal debts
that can’t be measured in marks, or to end wars before
they begin. Shards are scarce, even in Alethkar (which
has an unusually high number of Shards compared to
other countries). A highprince would count themself
lucky to have more than two sets of Shardplate and a
handful of Blades. However, some of the most powerful
individuals on Roshar have enough sets to lend to their
best retainers or citizens who need them for duels.
Each Shardblade and set of Shardplate is unique,
and they each carry a storied past, told across
generations of generals, usurpers, and rulers. Some
are intertwined with specific families or groups, while
others have passed through many hands over the ages
and across far-flung battlefields. A player character
might have a family connection to a specific Shardblade
if it was used by (or against) their ancestors in the past.
Shards can sometimes be won in duels, but generally,
nobody with Shards will accept such a duel against
someone who doesn’t have a Shard of their own to put
on the line. This makes it extremely difficult for anyone
without Shards to acquire them. Custom dictates
that anyone who kills a Shardbearer on the battlefield
wins their Shards, but actually performing such a feat
requires a combination of impeccable skill and uncanny
fortune. Most who stand before a Shardbearer on the
field of war simply die.

ongoing loyalty through good leadership, troops under
your command generally obey your orders without
question. When you do need to make a test to give a
difficult order to one of these subordinates, you gain
an advantage on the test.
Example Title: Mid-Ranking Scion
A mid-ranking scion serves both as a religious leader
and a government official in Azir. They travel the
country, performing blessings on settlements and formal
meetings, interpreting omens and events to determine
the will of the Kadasixes, and providing theological
guidance and spiritual purity assessments to the viziers
when selecting governmental candidates. They also fill
other bureaucratic roles like scribing and clerical work.
An effective scion can easily navigate Azish bureaucracy

access to both Azish governmental and religious

contradict policy or religious doctrine, you have
authority to direct lower-ranking scions and other Azish
government workers to aid you in research or menial
tasks while you concentrate on more important matters.
These generally don’t require you to make a test, but
when you need to make one, you gain an advantage
on the test.

## CORE RULEBOOK VERSION CORE RULEBOOK VERSION

```
Neither voice is right or wrong. Use whatever
feels comfortable for you, the character you’re trying
to portray, and the dynamics of the group you’re
playing with.
```

```
First-Person Roleplaying
When focusing on first-person roleplay, you really try
to embody your character. You describe your character’s
actions as things you yourself are doing. You often speak
as if you were your character, perhaps even acting out
their facial expressions, speaking in a way that evokes
their social status or occupation, and even mimicking
some of their actions (the ones you can reasonably do
around a table). This approach can be immersive and
fun as you find your character’s literal voice and embody
their emotions to the fullest. And to take your dialogue
to the next level, consider collecting a few cultural
touchpoints to weave in as they become relevant.
As always, remember that roleplay should draw
others in and invite them into play, not make them
uncomfortable. If you decide to use expressive gestures,
respect the personal space of your fellow players;
similarly, if you decide to develop a unique pattern
of speech, avoid using accents based on real-world
cultures. When done mindfully, going deep into
character creates chances for everyone at the table
to do the same.
Third-Person Roleplaying
When focusing on third-person roleplay, you convey
your character’s actions using the third person. You
refer to your character by name, describe their actions
and what they say to others, and narrate their mood
and thought process. This approach can be especially
helpful during emotionally charged scenes or any time
you don’t feel comfortable with acting something out.
Third-person narration also excels at letting your fellow
players peek behind the curtain while you articulate
your character’s thoughts, emotions, and state of mind.
If your character has an insensitive or particularly
contentious personality, third-person roleplaying can
help everyone at the table separate your character’s
behavior from what you personally believe is acceptable
or fair. For example, you might say, “Because my
character’s obstacle is selfishness, he’s going to try to
demand payment for helping the tallew farmers.”

rough your highs and lows—from toiling
at the bottom of chasms in the Shattered Plains
to soaring free in the clouds over Emul—your
adventures on Roshar tell a story of your personal
struggles, tests of will, and triumphs over ancient
grudges. The rules across this book can apply to
countless situations; take from them whatever’s helpful,
but ultimately keep only the rules that serve your story.
This chapter covers the basics of how to go
adventuring in Roshar and how you might use this
book’s rules to facilitate that. Some of this guidance
is roleplay focused, such as exploring how to pace your
story and how to use the game’s three scene types to
weave interesting adventures. The later sections of this
chapter focus on specific rules you’ll commonly use
across all scene types, such as how to handle various
conditions, resolve damage, and heal from injuries.
```

```
Roleplaying
Each scene follows a standard rhythm, as outlined
in this book’s introduction:
```

◆ (^) The GM sets the scene.
◆ (^) The players decide what they do.
◆ (^) The GM narrates the results.
During this cycle, you and the other players act out the
roles of your characters. It’s your job to determine how
your character speaks, thinks, and acts.
Approaches to Roleplaying
When playing your character, you’ll likely lean into
using one of two voices: either first-person or third-
person roleplaying. Some players use the same approach
most of the time, while others switch their approaches
based on what feels right for a given scene.

Time
Just like any story, the flow of time is at the heart of role-
playing. Sometimes, the story moves quickly, covering
large amounts of time. Other times, every heartbeat
matters and the action unfolds moment by moment,
detailing every movement your character makes.
The GM informally sets the pace of time based on
how each situation is unfolding. This often happens
subtly as the GM shifts the timescale they’re discussing.
For example, you might shift quickly between the
slow-paced “you travel through the Purelake for several
hours” and the fast-paced “you dive for cover when you
spot the ominous shapes of Fused flying low over the
water.” In this case, the GM didn’t formally proclaim
time was moving differently, but the needs of the story
changed it on the fly.
As you play out an adventure, the story naturally ebbs
and flows in this way. Sometimes you’ll “zoom out”
to allow time to pass by or events to unfold, and other
times you’ll “zoom in” on events that play out in detail.
Detailed moments like these—known as scenes—are
explained in the next section.
Faster-flowing parts of your story are more flexible.
In these scenes, long stretches of time pass, allowing
you to rest between difficult days, to travel for long
stretches of time, or to engage in downtime activities
between the active moments of an adventure. Most
of these moments can be handled like a montage in
a movie, but some things (like resting and downtime
activities) can have rules implications that are discussed
later in this chapter.
```

```
What Your Character Knows
When playing as your character, it’s important to
distinguish between what you (the player) know and
what your character knows. For example, there are likely
discrepancies between what you and your character are
skilled at; perhaps you made a deduction immediately
while your undiscerning character remains unaware.
Other times, you might know more about Roshar and its
history than your character does (or vice versa); perhaps
you remember global events from the novels that your
character hasn’t begun to experience yet. When playing
this game, it’s important to keep this divide between
character and player knowledge.
```

```
When You Know More
Than Your Character
Some players find it hard to resist the urge to use “out
of character” information to their benefit—especially if
their character not knowing something could result in
a “bad” outcome. Other players delight in the contrast
between their knowledge and their character’s, using
it to direct their unknowing character into dramatic
situations.
When you know something your character doesn’t,
focus on your character’s story and how you can use
your knowledge to enhance it. Instead your character
acting on impossible knowledge of things to come, you
can use those facts to set up interesting dramatic irony
or fun payoff for their narrative.
```

```
When Your Character
Knows More Than You
If you’re unfamiliar with some (or all) aspects of the
game’s setting, this doesn’t mean your character is!
When you feel like your character would reasonably
know something that you don’t (such as a detail about
their ancestry, culture, occupation, or expertises), ask
the GM for relevant information and context.
Your character isn’t limited by the GM’s knowledge
either. While it can be satisfying and flavorful for the
GM to describe how your character succeeds on a test,
they might simply summarize a situation (possibly
to keep the story moving or because they’re not sure
how your actions might unfold in Roshar). Either way,
remember your character still did a very cool thing
in the story, even though the camera didn’t zoom
in on them.
```

```
Splitting the Party
Sometimes the story necessitates splitting up your group
of characters. You might do this to accomplish multiple
things at once, or perhaps so characters can pursue
opposing objectives.
However, splitting the party can introduce a lot of chal-
lenges for pacing the story, as your scenes need to shift
between two or more different groups, leaving those who
aren’t in the current scene with little to do at the table.
Chapter 13 provides guidance for GMs on how to run the
party while split, but your game will likely run smoother if
you keep everyone together when it suits the story. Games
are most fun when everyone can participate.
```

**288** Chapter 9: Adventuring

```
Sometimes scenes happen in quick succession, and
what happens in one can have a dramatic impact on
your character’s abilities and resources in the next. At
other times, especially after particularly intense scenes,
the party may need a break to recover, or the story
may simply need to fast-forward until the next major
development. This time between meaningful scenes is
called downtime (described later in this chapter).
```

```
Statistics Across Scenes
When one scene rolls into the next, your character’s
statistics generally remain in the same state as in the
previous scene. For example, your current health, focus,
and Investiture remain the same until you get a chance
to recover them, whether through abilities or by spend-
ing a meaningful amount of time resting (see “Resting”
at the end of this chapter).
```

```
Scenes
When the action “zooms in” and your individual
actions have consequences, this is called a scene.
These sequences in the game can include harrowing
fights, tricky negotiations, exciting explorations, and
much more.
This game’s rules focus primarily on scenes, as
these typically need more guidance than fast-flowing
narratives. Most scenes can be categorized as one of
the following:
Combats occur when one or more characters engage in
a physically hostile conflict. In fights and battles, every
second matters, positioning requires precision, and
lives are on the line. Chapter 10 presents guidelines
for combats.
Conversations focus on times you’re communicating
with other characters when the outcomes are uncertain
and hold meaningful implications for the game’s story.
These involve heated arguments, tense negotiations,
intricate deceptions, and similar interactions.
Chapter 11 presents guidance for conversations.
Endeavors highlight times you’re trying to traverse,
explore, discover, pursue, or sneak. In these scenes,
your main opponent isn’t usually other characters—
instead, it’s the environment or situation itself.
Chapter 12 presents guidance for endeavors.
Not all sequences fit nicely into a single scene type—
for example, you might begin with a conversation that
quickly devolves into combat. And as with all rules of
this game, the scene rules are guidelines. The GM may
alter them, use only parts of a rule, or mix and match to
best tell the story of your adventure. For example, you
might use an action from the combat rules to throw a
punch in a conversation, or you might resist the social
influence of an NPC you’re conversing with during a
chase endeavor.
```

```
Transitioning Between Scenes
Momentum is essential to good gameplay. When one
scene’s main goal has been accomplished (or failed),
it’s generally time to wrap up the scene and move on to
the next. This helps the GM keep players excited and
motivated to continue the campaign.
Answering one question often presents another.
For example, the characters may celebrate dethroning
a predatory highlord through social skulduggery, only
to learn that someone worse has succeeded him. Or after
successfully crafting a new fabrial to aid the war effort,
the characters may learn the raw materials needed
to produce more are in short supply and can only be

```
Contributing to Events
The players and the GM can choose to contribute
to event tracks by spending Opportunities and
Complications to fill slots. When they do, they forgo
other possible effects these results would typically
have. This pushes players to strategically weigh the
impact of immediate consequences from spending an
Opportunity or Complication in a standard way, versus
bigger, long-term consequences of using it to contribute
to an event track. In so doing, events can add significant
tension to high-stakes scenes.
```

```
Opportunities
When you gain an Opportunity, you can choose to
spend it on a positive event, filling one slot when you
do. At times, it might make more sense to spend an
Opportunity on an immediate benefit such as recovering
focus that is sorely needed for a talent. But when an
event is in progress, you might want to progress toward
a moment that could turn the tide of an entire battle in
the group’s favor.
Complications
When you gain a Complication, the GM can choose
to spend it on a negative event, filling one slot when
they do. As always, they can choose to instead spend
it on something else; this flexibility helps the GM to
dramatically choose when a negative event is triggered,
such as a chasmfiend bursting into the scene just as your
characters are about to best your opponents in battle.
```

```
NPC Contributions
Just like you contribute to events, NPCs can as well.
However, unless they’re your allies, remember that
their Opportunities fill slots toward events with negative
implications for you, and their Complications fill slots
toward events with positive implications.
```

```
Events
Sometimes, the GM might introduce an event within a
scene. This optional tool is used to represent impending
circumstances that count down to a moment that’ll
shake up the scene. This building anticipation can add
dimension to any scene. Events can be either positive or
negative; either way, they act as ticking clocks that are
separate from the main objective of a scene.
Your GM might incorporate two or three events
into a game session. These are often divided between
scenes, but if the stakes are high and a lot is happening
at once, multiple events can occur in the same scene.
Meanwhile, some sessions might not include events
at all; they shouldn’t feel like random twists in each
session, but intentional devices to increase story tension
in important scenes.
It’s helpful to think of an event as similar to an
Opportunity or Complication, but with a larger scope
of impact. For example, an event might highlight a
highstorm bearing down on the group, the growing
outrage of a crowd watching an unfair duel, the arrival
of the city guards during your back-alley scuffle with a
Ghostblood agent, or the moments leading up to Dalinar
opening a perpendicularity to refuel your Stormlight
during a massive battle.
When the GM introduces an event, they’re fore-
shadowing something that’s not yet in play but will likely
come to fruition during the scene. Typically, an event
is triggered once you, your fellow players, and the GM
contribute a predetermined number of Opportunities
or Complications to that event.
```

```
Event Tracks
Events are always planned and instigated by the GM
unless otherwise indicated (such as by a talent). When
the GM is ready to introduce an event, they announce
what it is and whether it is positive or negative, then put
an event card in the middle of the table; while a card
isn’t necessary, it’s a nice visual reminder that the event
is in play.
Every event includes an event track with at least
two Opportunity or Complication slots (or both); the
number of each is chosen by the GM. When someone
rolls a plot die while an event is on the table, the result
of the die can be contributed to the event to progress it,
as described in the next section.

Triggering an Event

After all the Opportunity slots or Complication slots on
your event track are filled, this triggers the event that’s
been inching closer with each roll (such as the inexorable
advance of a highstorm).
Most events either track Opportunities or Comp-
lications, not both. However, for a more complex
outcome, the GM might choose to run two event tracks
simultaneously, contributing toward the possibility of
either a positive or negative outcome. For example, if
you’re waiting for much-needed reinforcements while a
highstorm inexorably approaches, you might contribute
Opportunities toward your allies’ advance, while
Complications count toward the highstorm arriving—
which will trigger first?

Downtime

Scenes account for most of the time you’ll spend playing
this game, but between them, your character’s life goes
on (such as while hiding, resting, working, or waiting).
If you’re just taking a break for a few hours or a night,
those rules are covered in the “Resting” section at the
end of this chapter. However, longer periods between
scenes offer **downtime** , in which individual characters
can progress without being restrained by their party’s

```
shared goals. During downtime, a GM presents you
and your fellow players with an opportunity to explain
what you do during this open time. Some activities
might be done in tandem with other party members, but
characters often want to go their own way for a while.
```

```
Introducing Downtime
When the game reaches a period of downtime, the GM
informs your group how much time you have before
your characters will be needed again. Sometimes your
characters are aware of how much time they have
(“report for duty in twelve hours”), but other times,
the GM might tell you the action will resume in two
days, even though your characters think they have
a week of vacation (“in two days, you’ll receive an
unexpected letter; what do you do between now and
then?”). The GM also explains any narrative restrictions
for your activities; for example, you might need to avoid
the spotlight, or you might need to remain within the
closed borders of a city on lockdown.
The type of activities you choose (and the progress
you can make on them) can vary based on the scope of
the break. If you’re just taking a few days off, a character
with the Surgeon path may choose to work as a traveling
doctor, perhaps making 5 marks for three days of work
```

```
Downtime Activity Ideas
This section summarizes some of the more common
downtime activities you might pursue, along with
suggested times and costs. However, you can spend the
time however you’d like; just discuss your idea with your
GM and they’ll help figure out how to resolve it.
```

```
Crafting
You can craft items and even powerful fabrials,
as described in the “Crafting” section of chapter 7.
Since crafting can require many days depending on the
complexity of the item, this activity is best accomplished
during downtime.
Working a Profession
You can engage in a profession, whether that’s perform-
ing odd jobs at a warcamp or managing your massive
estate you’ve been away from. If you have a patron or are
part of a larger organization, they might expect you to
work on their behalf.
```

```
Recuperating
Many injuries require time to heal. If you can dedicate
downtime to recovery, this greatly speeds the healing
process. Each day of downtime you spend dedicated to
rest and recuperation counts as two days toward healing
an injury (see “Injuries” later in this chapter).
Researching
Chaotic adventures and travel offer little opportunity for
careful research, so downtime is a great chance to study.
You might even gain insights into the unfolding mys-
teries of the cosmere. Research includes activities like
visiting devotaries to talk to the ardents, reading books
in the library, or experimenting with new technologies
in the lab.
When you begin your research, tell the GM what you
hope to discover. They’ll decide if this is something you
can find or discover, and if so, how many days of down-
time it’ll take and whether there are any restrictions.
Research usually takes 10 days or longer to uncover
truly important insights, and each day costs 3 marks in
supplies and other costs. Additionally, most research
requires you to succeed on one or more skill tests. For
example, you might need a Deduction test to connect
the dots on different pieces of information, a Lore test
to remember an author relevant to your research, or
a Persuasion test to convince an expert to help you.
Succeeding at your research can have many benefits.
It might unlock key information about your adventures
or give you insights into new fabrials, spren, or other
facts about the world.
```

```
in a remote town. Or a Radiant character could repair
their bond with their spren after a heated disagreement.
Meanwhile, downtime that spans many months has
much larger implications. A low-dahn character could
progress toward their lofty goal of rising to a higher
dahn by garnering favor with the local nobility. Or an
artifabrian might travel from nation to nation, training
allies to produce a new fabrial that changes the outcome
of a brewing war.
```

```
Resolving Downtime
Once you know the length and limitations of your
downtime, each player summarizes what their character
intends to do with their time; the “Downtime Activity
Ideas” section suggests activities and how you and the
GM might resolve those outcomes. After these sum-
maries, the GM works with one player to determine
that activity’s outcome, then repeats this with the
other players.
Simple and Ambitious Activities
You might choose a reasonable accomplishment for
your character, such as working at your longtime job or
taking the final steps toward speaking an Ideal you’ve
been progressing toward for some time. At the GM’s
discretion, many such activities don’t require tests to
resolve them. Other simple activities might require
a fairly easy skill test to resolve.
If your chosen downtime involves something
particularly ambitious, difficult, or integral to the
plot, you’ll likely have to raise the stakes on your test.
Be sure you’re comfortable with the risk of a Compli-
cation—though if you roll terribly on both your test
and plot die, the GM may choose to have mercy and
offer some sort of small concession.
```

```
Activity Outcomes
Once you make the required test (if any), you and the
GM decide the outcome, taking into consideration
your test result, Opportunities, and Complications.
At the GM’s discretion, resolutions could include
narrative rewards, money, items, or progress toward
individual goals.
Downtime Between Sessions
Rather than conducting downtime during a game
session, some groups enjoy transitioning into downtime
at the end of a session, then resolving their downtime
activities via group chat before the next session. You
might even enjoy using the time between sessions to
write and share a narrative of your downtime activities
(after working with the GM to resolve the outcome).
```

**292** Chapter 9: Adventuring

Training
If you dedicate your downtime to training, you can
improve yourself, potentially gaining a new expertise.
You can gain a specialist expertise in this way (such as
the Warhammer or Half-Shard expertise).
To do this, find a resource to help you in acquiring
the expertise—this might be a mentor, an excellent
reference book, or just lots of observation of the experts.
The GM then decides how much time it takes you to
learn and whether any skill tests are required.
It usually takes 20 days or longer to learn a new
expertise, and each day costs 5 marks in supplies
and other costs. Additionally, most training requires
you to succeed on a skill test relevant to your chosen
subject, and each failure adds more time or other
complications.

Self-Reflection
After the intense events and experiences of your
adventures, you might feel driven to reexamine
yourself and your values. If you dedicate 10 or more
days to self-reflection at the cost of 5 marks per day,
you can make mechanical changes to your character
(such as switching talents or skill ranks). Most players
use this for small tweaks such as swapping out a talent
or two you later realize don’t fit your character’s
current story. If you wish to make larger changes,
discuss with your GM how these changes will be
integrated into the story.
At the end of these 10 days of downtime, you can
rebuild your character using the “Starting at Higher
Levels” rules in chapter 13, but maintaining the same
number of levels you have now. All standard rules about
prerequisites apply, and if you’ve earned any rewards
during your adventures, they don’t count toward
prerequisites for earlier levels. For example, if your
character already spoke the Second Ideal, this doesn’t
mean you can choose a Third Ideal talent at the first
level of your rebuild.
You must work with your GM on this rebuild (no
matter how large or small), and it’s up to them whether
your changes fit the story. Be sure to tell them why you
wish to rebuild your character, and work together on
how it might impact the story and your character’s role
and relationships within the group.

```
Conditions
Many effects can apply a temporary condition to you
(for example, “you become Slowed”). These alter your
abilities for the duration of that effect, as described in
the upcoming “Durations” section.
If an effect doesn’t state its duration (or how you can
remove the condition early), all the rules you need for
determining that are in the condition itself.
Conditions generally only apply to characters,
not objects. For example, if a rule tells you to apply
a condition to targets in a certain area, objects in that
area ignore that condition. However, when it fits the
story, the GM might decide that objects are affected
by a condition (or by a similar narrative effect).
This game includes the following conditions,
listed in alphabetical order.
```

```
Afflicted
While Afflicted, you slowly take damage over time.
In combat, at the end of each of your turns, you take
the amount and type of damage specified by the
effect that gave you the condition; this information
is typically stated in brackets. For example, if you’re
Afflicted [1d4 vital], you take 1d4 damage at the end of
each of your turns.
Out of combat, you instead take that damage every
10 seconds and after each time someone attempts to
remove the condition.
Unlike most conditions, you can be Afflicted by
multiple effects simultaneously. When this happens,
resolve each effect separately.
```

```
Determined
While Determined, when you fail a test, you can add
an Opportunity to the result. After you choose to do so,
remove the Determined condition.
```

```
Disoriented
While Disoriented, your senses are disrupted, making
most tasks difficult. You can’t use reactions, your senses
always count as obscured, and Perception tests (and
similar tests to use your senses) gain a disadvantage.
```

```
Empowered
When a Knight Radiant swears an Ideal, they become
Empowered, granting a burst of unrestrained power.
While Empowered, you gain an advantage on all tests
and your Investiture refills to your maximum at the start
of each of your turns. Remove this condition at the end
of the current scene.
```

```
Chapter 9: Adventuring 293
```

```
Immobilized
While Immobilized, your movement rate becomes 0,
and you can’t move or be moved by other effects.
```

```
Prone
While Prone, you are lying flat on the ground. While
Prone, you are Slowed and melee attacks against
you gain an advantage. You can use the Brace action
without cover.
You can stand up and end this condition as. After
you do, your movement rate is reduced by 5 until the
start of your next turn.
If you become Prone while climbing or flying, you fall
and take damage as usual (see “Falling” in chapter 10).
```

```
Restrained
While Restrained, your movement rate becomes 0.
You gain a disadvantage on all tests other than those
to escape your bonds. If the effect that applies this
condition doesn’t state an escape DC, it’s up to the GM
whether and how the condition can be removed early.
```

```
Enhanced
While Enhanced, one of your attributes temporarily
increases, as specified in brackets when you gain that
condition. The specified attribute gains a bonus equal
to the specified number; however, this bonus doesn’t
change your defenses, maximum health, maximum
focus, or maximum Investiture.
For example, if you have a Speed of 3 and become
Enhanced [+2 Speed], you temporarily gain the
following benefits:
```

◆ (^) Gain a +2 bonus to Agility, Light Weaponry, Stealth,
and Thievery tests.
◆ (^) Gain a +2 bonus to any talents that directly use
your Speed.
◆ (^) Increase your movement rate from 30 feet to 40 feet.
Unlike most conditions, Enhanced has a cumulative
effect, and more than one of your attributes can be
Enhanced at a time.
Exhausted
While Exhausted, you feel fatigued and your skill tests
become more difficult.
When you gain this condition, it states a negative
number in brackets. After you calculate a test result but
before you resolve its effects, apply a penalty equal to
this number.
After each long rest, reduce your Exhausted penalty
by 1. The condition is removed when your penalty
equals 0.
Unlike most conditions, Exhausted has a cumulative
effect. When you gain a second instance of this
condition, add its listed penalty to your current
Exhausted penalty. For example, if an effect makes
you Exhausted [−2], you subtract 2 from the result of
all tests; if a different effect then makes you Exhausted
[−1], that increases your Exhausted penalty, so you
now subtract 3 from the result of all tests. As usual,
your final test result can’t be less than 0, regardless
of your penalty.
Focused
While Focused, you are engaged and intent on your
task. When you use an ability that costs focus, its cost
is reduced by 1.
**294** Chapter 9: Adventuring

```
Slowed
While Slowed, your movement rate is halved. If you
become Slowed in the middle of movement, halve your
remaining movement (rounded up).
```

```
Stunned
While Stunned in combat, you lose any reactions,
and on your turn, you gain two fewer and don’t gain
a reaction. While Stunned out of combat, you are
overwhelmed, making you move and react slower to
your situation at the GM’s discretion.
```

```
Surprised
While Surprised, you lose any reactions, you don’t
gain a reaction at the start of combat or on your turn,
you can’t take a fast turn, and you gain one fewer.
Remove this condition after your next turn.
```

```
Unconscious
While Unconscious, your movement rate becomes 0,
you can’t move or communicate, and you’re unaware of
your surroundings. When you gain this condition, you
fall Prone and drop anything you’re carrying. You can’t
interact with your surroundings or use any actions or
reactions other than the Breathe Stormlight action and
Regenerate free action (if you’re Radiant). In combat,
you always go slow, but you can’t do anything on your
turn (other than the above Radiant actions).
Enemies typically ignore Unconscious characters
unless they have a strong reason to do otherwise.
If you are a PC, you can choose to regain conscious-
ness at the end of any of your turns (no action required)
or when an effect heals you to at least 1 health. When
you do so, other characters can sense you’re conscious,
you remove the Unconscious condition, and if you’re at
0 health, you recover 1 health. But be careful: with such
low health, you could easily suffer another injury, this
one potentially more dangerous or deadly.
NPCs automatically regain consciousness when they
recover 1 health.
```

```
Durations
Some effects (such as conditions) last a specified number
of rounds. If you’re in combat when that effect begins,
note whether it begins in the fast PC phase, the fast
NPC phase, the slow PC phase, or the slow NPC phase
(see “Turn Phases” in chapter 10). The effect lasts
until the beginning of that phase on the next round.
Other effects state exactly when they end.
For example, if an effect ends “at the end of your
next turn,” it doesn’t matter if your next turn is fast
or slow—the effect ends when that turn does.
```

```
Food and Water
If you don’t eat and drink sufficient food and water each
day, you can begin suffering from exhaustion. When
you’re adventuring in an area with access to sufficient
food and water, your GM typically won’t ask you to
specifically track food and water, instead assuming
you’re keeping yourself sufficiently fed. However,
when your access to food and water might be limited
(such as when behind enemy lines or in Shadesmar),
the GM might have you track your food and water
more closely.
For simplicity, food and water are tracked per
day. One day of food or water is enough to feed or
hydrate one character for one day. If you can’t consume
sufficient food or water, you begin suffering ill effects.
```

```
Insufficient Food
You can go without food for a number of days up to
your Willpower score before you begin to feel ill effects.
For each day beyond this that you go without sufficient
food, you become Exhausted [−1]. If this reduces you to
Exhausted [−10] or lower, you die.
Once you consume a day’s worth of food, the count
of days resets (though you remain Exhausted), and you
can go without food for another number of days up to
your Willpower score before you suffer more exhaustion.
```

```
Insufficient Water
You can’t go long without water. For each day you go
without sufficient water, you become Exhausted [−1].
If this reduces you to Exhausted [−10] or lower, you die.
```

```
Damage, Injury, and Death
The risk of injury or death is nearly constant during the
True Desolation. These rules discuss how to handle
damage and injuries.
```

```
Damage
When you’re dealt damage , you reduce your current
health by that amount (see “Health” in chapter 3).
If you’re wearing armor, your deflect value might reduce
the amount of damage you suffer depending on that
damage’s type (see “Deflect” in chapter 3).
After you’re reduced to 0 health, you become
Unconscious and suffer an injury (see the upcoming
“Injuries” section), putting you at risk of serious injury
or death. Each time you take damage while at 0 health,
you suffer another injury. If your injury doesn’t kill
you, you remain Unconscious until you regain health
or choose to regain consciousness (as described in
“Conditions”).
```

```
Chapter 9: Adventuring 295
```

AMIRUL HHF

```
An injury roll is not a skill test. Rather, when you
make an injury roll, roll a d20 and apply the following
modifiers:
Armor. Add the deflect value of any armor
you’re wearing.
Abilities. Add any relevant modifiers from talents or
other abilities.
Injuries. Subtract 5 from the roll for each injury you
already have. (Unlike skill tests, the result of an injury
roll can be a negative number!)
Compare the result to the Injury Duration table to
determine the duration of your injury, then see “Injury
Effects” to determine its impact.
```

```
Injury Duration
Injury Roll Duration
−6 or lower Death. You die (see “Death”).
−5 to 0 Permanent Injury. You suffer a permanent injury.
1 to 5 Vicious Injury. You suffer a temporary injury with
a duration of 6d6 days.
6 to 15 Shallow Injury. You suffer a temporary injury with
a duration of 1d6 days.
16+ Flesh Wound. You suffer a temporary injury until
after a long rest.
```

```
Injury Effects
Each injury remains until it heals (or for permanent
injuries, potentially forever). When your character
suffers an injury, you decide its effects. To do so,
consider what caused the injury and what narrative
you’re interested in for your character.
The Injury Effects table suggests some effects an
injury could have and how you might describe it in the
story. Feel free to choose any entry on the table, roll
a d8 on the table, or work with your GM to create a
custom effect.
```

```
Injury Effects
d8 Effect Narrative Suggestions
1–2 Exhausted [−1] Any injury that lowers your overall
stamina.
3 Exhausted
[−2]
```

```
Any injury that lowers your overall
stamina.
4–5 Slowed Injured leg or foot, or any injury that
lowers your overall speed.
6 Disoriented Injured head, or widespread injury that
overwhelms your senses.
7 Surprised Overwhelmed by the shock of an injury.
8 Can only use
one hand
```

```
Injured arm or hand, or any injury that
lowers your overall coordination.
```

```
Damage Types
Different weapons, surges, and other effects deal
different damage types. Most effects state what type of
damage they deal. If an effect “deals extra damage” but
doesn’t specify the type, the effect deals the same type
as the underlying damage dealt.
The type doesn’t usually change an effect, but other
rules may affect some damage types. For example, if
your armor gives you a deflect value, this reduces the
damage you take when dealt energy, impact, or keen
damage (see “Armor” in chapter 7). Similarly, some
adversaries are less affected by certain damage types.
When determining the damage type of various effects
in your story, use the following guidelines:
Energy. Effects related to heat and energy (such as fire
and lightning) deal energy damage. This damage type
is reduced by your deflect value.
Impact. Effects that crush or bludgeon (such as a
hammer blow or a flying boulder) deal impact damage.
This damage type is reduced by your deflect value.
Keen. Effects that slice, puncture, or impale (such as
a dagger or sharp wooden spikes) deal keen damage.
This damage type is reduced by your deflect value.
Spirit. Effects that damage both your physical and
spiritual self deal spirit damage. This is usually dealt
by Shardblades, but a few surges can also do so. This
damage type is not reduced by your deflect value.
Vital. Effects that put your constitution to the test (such
as poison, suffocation, and extreme cold) deal vital
damage. This damage type is not reduced by your
deflect value.
```

```
Injuries
Your health represents your general physical wellbeing
and stamina, as described in chapter 3. As you recover
health, you quickly heal minor wounds like scrapes and
bruises. But when you suffer particularly grievous harm,
you might suffer an injury that takes a while to heal—
or that never heals at all.
```

```
Suffering an Injury
You always suffer an injury when you’re reduced to
0 health and when you take damage while at 0 health.
Other effects (such as talents and weapon traits) can
also cause injuries, and the GM can decide to inflict
an injury when the story calls for it.
Injury Rolls
When you suffer an injury, you must make an injury
roll. Major NPCs, such as recurring characters, make
injury rolls in the same way. (For less prominent NPCs,
see “Minor NPC and Injuries.”)
