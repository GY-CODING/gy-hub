###### Protective Bond

```
Prerequisite: Animal Bond talent
Activation:
With a word or gesture, you command your animal
companion to defend others.
You assign your animal companion to protect an ally
within 30 feet of you, and your animal companion
moves to that ally’s side. While your animal companion
remains within reach of the ally, you lose the bonus to
your defenses from your Animal Bond, and the ally
gains this bonus instead.
You can end this effect as if you’re within 30 feet
of your animal companion and can influence them,
at which point the animal companion returns to your
side. Otherwise, this effect ends at the end of the scene.
```

###### Surefooted

```
Prerequisite: Experienced Trapper talent
Activation:
You move through treacherous terrain with confidence
and speed.
When you acquire this talent, increase your movement
rate by 10.
Additionally, before you take damage from dangerous
terrain or falling, reduce that damage by 2 × your tier.
```

```
Additionally, after a long rest in the wilderness, you
can fashion a tool from natural materials using your
Survival modifier instead of Crafting (see “Crafting”
in chapter 7). This foraged tool could be a spear, sling,
tent, or another survival tool that can be made from
materials found in the area, as determined by the GM.
Finally, when you acquire this talent, the damage
from your Deadly Traps talent increases from 2d
to 2d6, and when that talent applies a condition,
its duration increases from 1 round to 2 rounds.
```

###### Feral Connection

```
Prerequisite: Survival 2+; Protective Bond talent
Activation:
Your animal companion has grown strong under
your care and has learned to trust your instincts
as much as their own.
When you acquire this talent, your animal
companion’s maximum and current health increase
by 5 × your tier; when your tier increases, your animal
companion’s health does as well.
They also increase their Physical, Cognitive,
and Spiritual defenses by 2 each. When your animal
companion makes a test, they add a bonus equal to
your ranks in Survival.
Additionally, when you acquire this talent, gain a
utility expertise in Animal Care.

```
Prerequisite: Survival 3+; Experienced Trapper talent
Activation:
You put your traps and animal companion to best
use, inflicting devastating wounds with all the tools in
your arsenal.
Your animal companion gains an advantage on tests
against your quarry.
Additionally, when you acquire this talent, the
damage from your Deadly Traps talent increases from
2d6 to 2d8, and when that talent applies a condition,
its duration increases from 2 rounds to 3 rounds.
```

###### Pack Hunting

```
Prerequisite: Perception 3+; Protective Bond talent
Activation:
Like a predator who hunts in groups, you expose your
quarry’s weaknesses, enabling your allies to fight alongside
you with terrifying coordination.
When an ally in your line of effect attacks your quarry,
you can use this reaction and spend 1 focus to add your
ranks in Survival to either the result of their attack test
or their damage roll (your choice).

VALERIA CASALE

```
Beacons of encouragement and direction, leaders
oversee the efforts of others. Some are born with
an unquenchable thirst for power and influence.
Others solemnly accept their calling out of a sense
of duty. Either way, skilled leadership requires both
natural aptitude and dedicated learning. Mistakes
are unavoidable, and indecision is a costly pitfall.
When worsening conditions cause followers
to doubt, Leaders rise to the occasion, bolstering
fellowship and resolve to carry on. Though filling this
role often proves lonely and burdensome, Leaders can
gloriously turn the tides of fate and prevail against
superior forces.
```

##### Leader Specialties

```
The Leader path presents talents in three specialties:
Champion. Inspiring others through unfaltering
grit, Champions ferociously charge their foes.
Their momentum is magnetic, rallying nearby allies
to press on.
Officer. Officers coolly maintain order in utter chaos.
They allocate resources and issue commands,
orchestrating the march to victory.
Politico. With a penchant for theatrics, Politicos
chase favor and prestige while subtly undermining
their enemies.
```

##### Building a Leader

```
The following “Leaders of Roshar” section suggests
example builds for iconic characters. If you have a
different idea in mind, consider these general tips for
building an effective Leader:
Attributes. It’s usually a good idea to prioritize
Presence, Strength, and Willpower.
Skills. Useful skills include Athletics, Deception, Heavy
Weaponry, Intimidation, Leadership, and Persuasion.
Other Heroic Paths. The Warrior and Envoy paths
make excellent multi-path choices.
Rewards. When choosing rewards, you can’t go wrong
with a mount companion, high-ranking military title,
and possibly even Shardplate.

characters.
```

###### Azish Vizier

```
Second only to the Prime Aqasix, viziers are the beating
heart of the Azish bureaucracy. In addition to selecting
and advising each Prime Aqasix, these revered scribes
write legislation, requisition resources such as Imperial
Shardblades throughout the empire, educate constables,
and more. Regardless of one’s status at birth, becoming
a vizier bestows an air of dignity and accomplishment.
The intricate robes and swanky hat are nice perks too.
Building a Vizier. Choose human ancestry and
the Azish and High Society cultural expertises. Start
with high Intellect and Willpower. In addition to the
Leadership skill rank you gain from Leader, put 1 rank
into Deduction, Leadership, Lore, and Deception.
In addition to the Decisive Command (Leader Key)
talent, use your human ancestry to choose the Cutthroat
Tactics talent from the Politico specialty. Finally,
choose the Courtier starting kit.
As you level up, consider working toward the
Well Dressed and Shrewd Command talents.
```

###### Warform Commander (Listener)

```
Leaping across chasms with unparalleled grace and
vigor, warform commanders exude tenacity. They
avoid clashing with human armies if there’s nothing
to gain, as listeners are generally outnumbered and not
particularly interested in bloodshed. When engaged,
listeners counter Alethi malice with fierce competition
and tactics that emphasize close coordination between
allies. Warform commanders are undeterred by
swarming enemies, and they seize every chance to carve
a gemheart from a chasmfiend chrysalis and bid their
bested rivals farewell.
Building a Warform Commander. Choose singer
ancestry and the Listener and Alethi cultural expertises.
Start with high Strength and Willpower. In addition
to the Leadership skill rank you gain from Leader,
put 2 ranks into Athletics, and put 1 rank into Heavy
Weaponry and Leadership.
In addition to the Decisive Command (Leader Key)
talent and the Change Form (Singer Key) talent, use
your singer ancestry to choose the Forms of Resolve
singer talent and begin in warform. Finally, choose the
Military starting kit.
As you level up, consider working toward the Mighty
and Resilient Hero talents from the Champion specialty.
Also consider talents from the Scholar’s Strategist
specialty and the Warrior’s Soldier specialty.

###### Veden Sergeant

```
Veden sergeants value synergy over brute force, and
they use it to devastating effect in the service of their
highprinces. They are famous for their expertly
coordinated armies of raiders. Even in the grimmest of
battles, Veden sergeants trust in the compliance of their
troops, enabling them to execute challenging assaults
and win the day.
Building a Veden Sergeant. Choose human
ancestry and the Veden and Military Life cultural
expertises. Start with high Willpower and Presence.
In addition to the Leadership skill rank you gain from
Leader, put 2 ranks into Persuasion, put 1 rank into
Leadership, and put 1 rank into either Heavy Weaponry
or Light Weaponry.
In addition to the Decisive Command (Leader Key)
talent, use your human ancestry to choose the Through
the Fray talent from the Officer specialty. Finally,

As you level up, consider working toward the
Synchronized Assault talent then adding Composed
for additional focus.

acumen is renowned. This battle-won wisdom benefits

When you acquire this talent, gain a command die,

After rolling, they can choose one die roll from that test,
other than the plot die, and add the command die to
that roll.
Some Leader talents allow you to use your command
die in other ways; you can do so even if an ally currently
has a command die from you.

direct your squad to focus their full power on a single
crucial foe.
Spend 2 focus to make a Leadership test against the
Cognitive defense of an enemy you can sense. On a
success, choose a number of allies up to your ranks
in Leadership. On a failure, choose one ally you can
influence. On the next turn of each of your chosen
allies, they gain that can be spent only to Strike

Describe a potential source of conflict (such as suspicion
or jealousy), then make a Leadership test (DC equals
highest Spiritual defense among those targets). On a
success, you influence each target to become hostile
toward the other targets, which sparks an argument,
combat, or other conflict until they find a way to
resolve it.
A target can resist this influence, but after they
do, they lose additional focus equal to your ranks in
Leadership. If only some of the targets resist influence,
the others remain hostile, but their conflict might
become easier to resolve.
```

###### Shrewd Command

```
Prerequisite: Leadership 2+; Rumormonger talent
Activation:
With a biting word or strategic glance, you cut to the heart

ANDREA MONTALTO

```
Creativity, acumen, and patience are hallmarks of
legendary Scholars. Each time a Desolation sweeps
away centuries of progress and scientific advancement,
Scholars rise to build Roshar anew.
To a Scholar, every mystery is a challenge with a
befitting prize. Some Scholars devote their research to
famines, barren lands, and related food crises. Others
study the body, how it functions, and how to restore
it after injury and illness. But not all Scholars occupy
themselves with bettering society—some instead pursue
tools of destruction. Military Scholars often devise new
instruments of war and calculate how to best pressure
enemy forces.
No matter their field of study, Scholars use their
insatiable hunger for knowledge to change the world
for better or worse, one brilliant discovery at a time.
```

##### Scholar Specialties

```
The Scholar path presents talents in three specialties:
Artifabrian. Combining science, engineering, and
artistry, Artifabrians use polestones and metal casings
to construct fabrials that perform precise functions.
Strategist. Always three steps ahead, Strategists know
timing is everything and make it work to their benefit.
Surgeon. Qualified Surgeons apply their knowledge and
empathy to heal the unwell and save lives.
```

##### Building a Scholar

```
The following “Scholars of Roshar” section suggests
example builds for iconic characters. If you have a
different idea in mind, consider these general tips
for building an effective Scholar:
Attributes. It’s usually a good idea to prioritize Intellect
above all else, then Presence plus either Speed
or Strength (depending on your desired combat
functionality).
Skills. Useful skills include Crafting, Deduction, Lore,
and Medicine.
Other Heroic Paths. The Agent and Envoy paths
make excellent multi-path choices.
Rewards. When choosing rewards, you can’t go
wrong with fabrials, a companion to mentor, and
a Soulcaster.

###### Kharbranthian Surgeon

```
Trained at the Great Concourse of Kharbranth,
hospital surgeons in the City of Bells have the best
medicines and tools at their disposal. They freely
share research and advancements with colleagues,
everyone doing their part to uphold the city’s venerated
reputation. Funded entirely by the city’s Palanaeum,
Kharbranthian surgeons aim to provide exemplary care
for anyone who walks through their wards, treating
physiological illnesses and addressing mental health
concerns free of charge. Medical practice doesn’t begin
or end with identifying what’s wrong; people are more
than their diagnoses, so a skilled surgeon focuses on
becoming a carer and healer of the whole person.
Building a Kharbranthian Surgeon. Choose
human ancestry, the Kharbranthian cultural expertise,
and one other cultural expertise. Start with high
Intellect and Willpower. In addition to the Lore skill
rank you gain from Scholar, put 2 ranks into Medicine,
and 1 rank into Athletics and Lore.
For your Erudition (Scholar Key) talent, choose
your preferred field of medicine (such as Pediatrics,
Psychiatry, Diagnostics, or Surgery) as your bonus
expertise, and put your bonus skill ranks into Lore
and Medicine. Use your human ancestry to choose
the Field Medicine talent from the Surgeon specialty.
Finally, choose the Artisan starting kit.
As you level up, consider taking Emotional
Intelligence (putting the bonus skill rank into
Insight) and working toward Ongoing Care.
```

###### Stormwarden

```
Adorned in glyph-covered robes, stormwardens
are often employed by governments across Roshar.
Their skill in predicting highstorms is an enigmatic
and complex art appreciated by all but the strictest
Vorins. Adding to their allure, stormwardens conduct
their work in a secretive glyph-based script decipherable
only by fellow stormwardens. Unfortunately, some
charlatans sell haphazardly calculated charts in
city squares, making a mockery of the remarkable
discoveries in mathematics, ecology, and geography
used by formally trained stormwardens.
```

### Scholar

###### Heroic Path

**106** Chapter 4: Heroic Paths

```
Building a Stormwarden. Choose human ancestry
and the Alethi and Wayfarer cultural expertises. Start
with high Speed and Intellect. In addition to the Lore
skill rank you gain from Scholar, put 2 ranks into
Deduction and Light Weaponry.
For your Erudition (Scholar Key) talent, choose
Meteorology as your bonus expertise, and put your
bonus skill ranks into Deduction and Lore. Use your
human ancestry to choose the Strategize talent from
the Strategist specialty. Finally, choose the Academic
starting kit.
As you level up, consider taking the Mind and
Body talent (putting the bonus skill rank into Light
Weaponry) and working toward Know Your Moment,
Deep Contemplation, and Turning Point.
```

###### Vriztl Engineer

```
The engineers of Thaylenah rank among the most
accomplished artifabrians on Roshar, thanks to their
boundless passion and persistence. Their secretive
guilds, such as the Vriztl Guild, guard state-of-the-art
innovations in fabrial construction. Vriztl engineers
take copious notes about their failures, believing that
such records contain vital leads to future successes.

```
Artifabrians
Unique to Roshar, the artifabrian is a creator, scholar,
tinkerer, and planner. They tend to be as curious and
divergent in their thinking as they are structured in their
processes and meticulous in their recordkeeping. Some
artifabrians enjoy surrounding themselves with other
like-minded individuals, while others prefer secrecy—
especially when it comes to their machinations.
Artifabrians come from all walks and stations of life,
but many either depend on a wealthy patron or serve
as one themselves. Some Artifabrians act as visionaries
who direct a cadre of ardents and scholars to create
the future, while others enjoy taking a more hands-on
approach to their work.
Known as incredible problem-solvers, artifabrians relish
testing their intellect and creativity against whatever the
world throws against them. By bending both metal and
spren to their will, artifabrians aim to change the world in
ways both mundane and magnificent. Most artifabrians
focus their craft on certain types of fabrials, gradually
learning to modify existing fabrials in novel ways; however,
every artifabrian dreams of leaving their mark on Roshar
by creating a wholly new fabrial, the likes of which has
never been seen before.

After many generations of this diligent recordkeeping,
the Vriztl Guild has gained a significant edge in fabrial
development, and Vriztl engineers further their legacy
with every fabrial they craft.
Building a Vriztl Engineer. Choose human
ancestry, the Thaylen cultural expertise, and one other
cultural expertise. Start with high Speed and Intellect.
In addition to the Lore skill rank you gain from Scholar,
put 2 ranks into Crafting, put 1 rank into Lore, and put
1 rank into either Agility or Light Weaponry (depending
on which fabrial you plan to make; see “Inventing
Unique Fabrials” in chapter 7).
For your Erudition (Scholar Key) talent, choose
Equipment Crafting as your bonus expertise, and put
your bonus skill ranks into Crafting and Lore. Use
your human ancestry to choose the Prized Acquisition
talent from the Artifabrian specialty. Finally, choose
the Academic starting kit.
As you level up, consider working toward the
Inventive Design, Overcharge, and Experimental
Tinkering talents.
```

##### Scholar Key Talent

```
The Scholar key talent, Erudition, unlocks access to the
Scholar specialties.
Starting Skill: Lore. If you choose Scholar as your
starting path, gain a free skill rank in Lore.
```

###### Erudition (Scholar Key)

```
Prerequisite: none
Activation:
You’ve conditioned your mind to quickly assimilate,
archive, and recall information. After brief but intensive
study, you can navigate your newest areas of focus with
impressive proficiency.
When you acquire this talent, you become adroit at
mental organization. Choose one cultural or utility
expertise you don’t already have, and choose two
different cognitive skills that aren’t surge skills.
When you make a test, you count as having the
chosen expertise, and you count as having one
additional rank of each of the chosen skills.
You can use this talent to gain skill ranks even
if they exceed your usual maximum for skill ranks.
This talent’s expertise and skill ranks are temporary
and don’t count toward prerequisites.
After a long rest during which you had access to a
library, you can reassign any expertises and skill ranks
granted by this talent. Follow the same rules to choose
them as you did when you gained this talent.
```

##### Artifabrian Specialty

```
The following talents, presented here in alphabetical
order, appear in the Artifabrian specialty on the Scholar
talent tree.
```

###### Deep Study

```
Prerequisite: Efficient Engineer talent
Activation:
Driven by academic inquiry, you love nothing more than
getting lost in an archive of books, scrolls, and dusty secrets.
When you acquire this talent, your Erudition talent
grants you one additional cultural or utility expertise,
and it grants you two additional cognitive skills that
aren’t surge skills. You can reassign these in the same
way as the others you gained from that talent.
```

###### Efficient Engineer

```
Prerequisite: Crafting 1+; Erudition key talent
Activation:
Solid work begins with practice and fundamentals like
measuring twice before each cut. You’ve put in the hours,
sweat, tears, and occasional blood to learn the basic tricks
of the tinkerer’s trade.
When you acquire this talent, gain a utility expertise
in Armor Crafting, Equipment Crafting, or Weapon
Crafting. You also gain one of the following from
chapter 7:
```

◆ (^) An **_amplifying painrial_**
◆ (^) A **_numbing painrial_**
◆ (^) A pair of **_spanreeds_** plus an **_emotion bracelet_**
Additionally, when you attempt to craft an item or
invent a fabrial (see “Crafting” in chapter 7), your
Opportunity range on those tests expands by 2, and
any cost to acquire raw materials is reduced by half.

###### Experimental Tinkering

```
Prerequisite: Fine Handiwork talent
Activation:
You’ve honed your instinct for when to sacrifice one
feature to enhance another; after all, invention relies not
only on ingenious breakthroughs, but also on carefully
balanced tradeoffs.
When you craft an item or invent a fabrial, your
Opportunity range on those tests expands by 1,
and your crafting time is halved.
Additionally, you can forgo the usual benefits of a
long rest to instead spend that time tinkering with a
fabrial that uses your Prized Acquisition gem. After
that long rest, you can attempt to reconfigure this
fabrial to create a different fabrial of the same tier or
lower; this follows the normal crafting process, except
you don’t need new materials and you ignore the usual
```

**108** Chapter 4: Heroic Paths

```
time requirement for attracting a spren and crafting the
fabrial. If you fail your Lore test to trap a spren, your
previous fabrial remains intact, but you can’t use this
talent to reconfigure a fabrial again until your next long
rest. After you finish crafting a new fabrial using this
talent, the old fabrial is lost.
```

###### Fine Handiwork

```
Prerequisite: Efficient Engineer talent
Activation:
Your dedication to quality and love for innovation ensure
that your designs stand out from the crowd.
When you craft an item or invent a fabrial, you can
spend one upgrade to apply an advanced feature, instead
of spending two upgrades. You can only benefit from
this talent once per item.
```

###### Inventive Design

```
Prerequisite: Crafting 2+; Prized Acquisition talent
Activation:
Your custom fabrials often integrate novel functionalities
thanks to your deep knowledge of the stone with which you
most commonly work.
When you craft a fabrial using your gemstone from your
Prized Acquisition, you can select an effect of 1 tier
higher than the tier you’re currently crafting.
```

###### Overcharge

```
Prerequisite: Crafting 3+; Prized Acquisition talent
Activation:
You push fabrials to their limits, overcharging them beyond
conventional use or safe practice.
Once per turn, when you make an attack test using a
fabrial, you can raise the stakes.
You can spend from this test to use the Strike
action with that fabrial as on the same turn; that
Strike doesn’t count against your allowed number of
Strikes for the hands holding that weapon.
The GM can spend from this test to add one new
drawback to that fabrial. This drawback remains until
you resolve the unexpected issue by succeeding on a
DC 15 Crafting test made as.
```

###### Overwhelm With Detail

```
Prerequisite: Lore 3+; Experimental Tinkering talent
Activation:
When speaking about a topic you’re passionate about, you
do so with unsurpassed authority and at unmatched length.
The uninitiated can rarely withstand such a torrent of
information without becoming lost amid the data.
Spend 2 focus to make a cognitive or spiritual test using
your Lore modifier instead of the usual skill modifier
for that test.
```

###### Prized Acquisition

```
Prerequisite: Erudition key talent
Activation:
Through good fortune or hard work, you’ve acquired a
gemstone of sufficient quality to practice crafting fabrials.
When you acquire this talent, you gain a specialist
expertise in Fabrial Crafting.
Additionally, you gain a specially cut gemstone and
can use it to craft a fabrial (see “Crafting” in chapter 7).
The first time you attempt to craft a fabrial with this
gem, you ignore the usual time requirements for attract-
ing a spren and crafting the fabrial, thanks to previous
study and tinkering, though you still need raw materials.
This gem fulfills the gem requirement for a unique
fabrial with a tier equal to your current character tier.
You can’t bear to sell or trade this gem, as it is vital
to your work! If for any reason you lose it, you can
usually find an appropriate replacement after a long
rest, though the GM is the final arbiter of when you
can replace it. During downtime, you can salvage your
fabrial to recover this gem, which you can then use in a
new fabrial (ignoring the crafting rule that prevents the
reuse of gems).

##### Warriors of Roshar

```
If you’d like to draw on the Stormlight Archive for
inspiration, consider these builds for iconic Warrior
characters.
```

###### Alethi Duelist

```
In Alethkar, martial skill is seen as requisite for leader-
ship, and many Shardplate-clad brightlords take to the
arena or battlefield to demonstrate their potency and
crush their foes. Some specialize in duels, where Shards
are often wagered on the outcome—a prize especially
tempting for a duelist who relies on borrowed Shard-
plate. A victorious duel yields vast riches and acclaim,
whether for the winner or the highprince they serve.
Building an Alethi Duelist. Choose human
ancestry, the Alethi cultural expertise, and one other
cultural expertise. Start with high Strength and Will-
power. In addition to the Athletics skill rank you gain
from Warrior, put 2 ranks into Heavy Weaponry, and
put 1 rank into Athletics and Perception.
In addition to the Vigilant Stance (Warrior Key)
talent, use your human ancestry to choose the
Stonestance talent from the Shardbearer specialty.
Finally, choose the Military starting kit.
As you level up, consider working toward the Mighty
and Shattering Blow talents. When you acquire your
own Shardblade or Shardplate (see “Rewards” in
chapter 8), choose the Shard Training talent so you
can safely wield it.
```

###### Bridge Runner

```
Not only the elite are warriors in Alethkar. Whe-
never war breaks out, citizens of all ranks are
recruited—or drafted—to serve in armies. Alethkar’s
most recent military venture is the so-called War of
Reckoning against the listeners of the Shattered Plains.
On both sides of this conflict, countless soldiers have
become unwilling participants in a war they don’t
desire. The least fortunate are conscripted into bridge
crews, carrying heavy wooden bridges to span the
chasms of the Shattered Plains.
Building a Bridge Runner. Choose human
ancestry, the Alethi cultural expertise, and one other
cultural expertise. Start with high Strength and
Speed. In addition to the Athletics skill rank you gain
from Warrior, put 2 ranks into Discipline, put 1 rank
into Athletics, and put 1 rank into Heavy Weaponry,
Light Weaponry, or Survival.
In addition to the Vigilant Stance (Warrior Key)
talent, use your human ancestry to choose the Cautious
Advance talent from the Soldier specialty. Finally,
choose the Military or Prisoner starting kit.
```

```
Roshar is a world riven by conflict, and many of its
people follow the path of the Warrior, whether for
good or ill. A Warrior might view fighting as a calling,
an ethos, a profession, or simply an unpleasant necessity
for survival—but in all cases, battle follows the Warrior
like a shadow.
Those who survive long enough to become seasoned
fighters tend to be tough, resilient, and skilled at inflict-
ing harm. An experienced Warrior can handle themself
in any dangerous martial situation, whether a formal
duel, an alleyway scuffle, or a terrifying clash of armies.
```

##### Warrior Specialties

```
The Warrior path presents talents in three specialties:
Duelist. In the inner circles of the elite, skilled Duelists
contend for glory and political sway, wielding their
weapons with brutal grace.
Shardbearer. Warriors fortunate enough to own
(or borrow) Shardblades and Shardplate serve as
Shardbearers. They wield these arms and armor of
ancient provenance to dominate the battlefield with
mythic might.
Soldier. The most common of fighting forces, Soldiers
form the bulk of Roshar’s massive armies. They master
the tactics needed to fight effectively in units and stay
alive in a deadly world.
```

##### Building a Warrior

```
The following “Warriors of Roshar” section suggests
example builds for iconic characters. If you have a
different idea in mind, consider these general tips for
building an effective Warrior:
Attributes. It’s usually a good idea to prioritize Speed
and Strength, then consider Awareness and Willpower.
Skills. Useful skills include Athletics, Light Weaponry,
Heavy Weaponry, Intimidation, Leadership, and
Persuasion.
Other Heroic Paths. The Leader and Hunter paths
make excellent multi-path choices.
Rewards. When choosing rewards, you can’t go
wrong with a Shardblade, Shardplate, and a fancy
military title.
```

### Warrior

###### Heroic Path

**114** Chapter 4: Heroic Paths

```
As you level up, consider working toward the Combat
Training and Formation Drills talents, and adding
Hardy for additional health.
```

###### Warpair Partner (Listener)

```
Within listener culture, “warrior” is less a profession
and more a role one holds in time of conflict. Until
recently, the will and technique necessary to attract
the spren to enter warform was lost to time (see “Singer
Ancestry” in chapter 2). However, recent conflict has
pushed many listeners to become practiced in its use.
Most listeners enter battle in warpairs, partnered with
another listener they share a bond with. This is often
their once-mate, but could be another listener they are
very close with.
Building a Warpair Par t ner. Choose singer
ancestry and the Listener and Alethi cultural expertises.
Start with high Strength and Willpower. In addition
to the Athletics skill rank you gain from Warrior, put
2 ranks into Heavy Weaponry and Intimidation.
In addition to the Vigilant Stance (Warrior Key)
talent and the Change Form (Singer Key) talent, use
your singer ancestry to choose the Forms of Resolve
singer talent and begin in warform.
As you level up, take the Flamestance talent from
the Duelist specialty. Also consider working toward
Signature Weapon and Wit’s End.
```

##### Warrior Key Talent

```
The Warrior key talent, Vigilant Stance, unlocks access
to the Warrior specialties.
Starting Skill: Athletics. If you choose Warrior as
your starting path, gain a free skill rank in Athletics.

You can enter a stance you know by using that talent’s
stated number of actions. Your stance ends if you either
end it as , enter another stance, or end the scene. While
in a stance, you temporarily gain any actions, bonuses,
and other effects it grants; these effects end when the
stance does.
By default, you can only use stances during combat,
not during other scenes.

```

###### Practiced Kata

```
Prerequisite: Vigilant Stance key talent
Activation:
Your study of martial kata and other forms has taught you
that your stance in conversation is as important as in battle.
With practiced poise, you project the exact attitude you want
through body language and positioning.
When you acquire this talent, you can use fighting
stances in conversation and endeavor scenes, in
addition to combat. Activating or changing a stance
during a conversation or endeavor costs 1 focus and
counts as your contribution for the round.
Additionally, if you aren’t Surprised when a
combat, conversation, or endeavor scene begins,
you can enter Vigilant Stance at the beginning of
that scene (no action required).
```

###### Signature Weapon

You have trained extensively with a particular weapon
and can exploit all the advantages it offers.
When you acquire this talent, gain one weapon
expertise. Then choose one weapon type in which
you have an expertise and denote it in parentheses
after this talent’s name on your character sheet;
for example, “Signature Weapon (Longspear).”
Your Opportunity range for tests using this
weapon type expands by 1. When you reach tier 3,
this Oppor tunity range instead expands by 2.
```

###### Surefooted

```
Prerequisite: Ironstance talent
Activation:

Activation:
You assume a flexible stance, allowing you to quickly switch
between inexorable advances and rapid reactions to wear
down your foe.
```

**118** Chapter 4: Heroic Paths

```
When you acquire this talent, you learn a new stance,
which you can enter as :
Vinestance. Your Physical and Cognitive defenses
increase by 1. Additionally, after you’re hit or grazed by
a melee attack, you can use to make an Athletics test

horizontally up to 5 feet × your ranks in Athletics.
```

###### Wit’s End

```
Prerequisite: Intimidation 3+; Feinting Strike talent
Activation:
Battles are won and lost in moments of brief inattention
or exhaustion. You create and exploit these opportunities,
patiently waiting to vanquish your foe in a single stroke.
Spend 1 focus to move up to half your movement rate,
then make a melee weapon attack against the Cognitive
defense of a target who has 0 focus. This attack ignores
your target’s deflect value and deals an extra 4d6
damage on a hit. It can’t graze, only miss or hit.
This talent becomes more powerful as your tier
increases: at tier 3, you roll an extra 6d6 damage
(instead of 4d6); at tier 4, you instead roll an extra
8d6 damage; and at tier 5, you instead roll an extra
10d6 damage.

reach. While wearing Shardplate, you gain an advantage
on this test. Roll double the usual damage dice for this
attack. On a hit, each target whose Strength score is
lower than yours is also knocked Prone.
```

###### Mighty

```
Prerequisite: Stonestance talent
Activation:
You deliver your swings, punches, and kicks with
practiced efficiency.
When you hit with a weapon or unarmed attack, for
each you used on that attack’s action, increase the
damage you deal by 1 + your tier. For example, if you’re
level 6 and you make an attack that costs , each
deals an extra 1 + 2 damage, for a total of 6 damage.
```

###### Precise Parry

```
Prerequisite: Perception 3+; Shattering Blow talent
Activation:
A Shardbearer must know when to deflect an oncoming
blow, when to take it on their Shardplate, and when to
evade. In extreme cases, a desperate fighter even might
catch a Shardblade between their bare hands in a desperate
maneuver called a lastclap.
Before being hit by a melee attack, you can use this
reaction and spend 1 focus to attempt to parry the blow.
Depending on whether you’re unarmed or wielding a
weapon, make one of the following tests:
Unarmed. Make an Athletics test, gaining a disadvan-
tage unless you’re being attacked with a Shardblade.
You can spend to disarm your opponent, taking
control of their weapon (and wielding it, if you desire).
Wielding a Weapon. Make a Light Weaponry test or
Heavy Weaponry test (using the skill corresponding
to your weapon). If you’re wielding a Shardblade and
if your opponent’s weapon is non-Invested, you can
spend to destroy their weapon.
The DC of this test equals the result of the attack
test that hit you. On a success, the hit against you
becomes a graze.
```

###### Shard Training

```
Prerequisite: Access to a Shardblade and Shardplate
for training; Vigilant Stance key talent
Activation:
Given the rarity of Shardblades and Shardplate, it’s
exceptionally difficult to acquire firsthand experience
with these relics. You’ve managed this feat, learning to
deal blows for maximum effect and to absorb strikes as
efficiently as possible.
```

```
Once per round, when you use the Strike action to
attack with a Shardblade, you can choose a number
of additional enemies up to your ranks in the skill you
used for that Strike. Each target must be within your
Shardblade’s reach. Without spending focus, you graze
each additional target whose Physical defense is equal
to or lower than your Strike’s test result.
Additionally, when you acquire this talent, gain a
specialist expertise in Shardplate, and gain a specialist
expertise in either Grandbows, Shardblades, or
Warhammers.
Finally, while you wear Shardplate, it has 2 additional
charges for you.
```

###### Shattering Blow

```
Prerequisite: Perception 2+; Windstance talent
Activation:
Whether striking a barricaded door, a Shardbearer, or
a hapless enemy on the field, you know how to break
through weak points or send foes flying with a precise,
two-handed blow.
When you hit a target with a melee attack, if you did
so either with a two-handed weapon or with a hand
free, you can spend 2 focus to hit with remarkable force.
Before resolving that attack’s damage, if your target is
wearing armor with charges (such as Shardplate or a
half-shard), the armor loses 1 charge.
After that attack, each target who lost health to your
attack is pushed horizontally 5 feet away from you.
If your Strength is greater than 5, they’re pushed an
additional 5 feet for each additional point of Strength;
for example, if your Strength is 7, they’re pushed an
additional 10 feet, for a total of 15 feet. If your target
hits a Medium or larger object during this forced
movement, the target takes damage as if they’d fallen
the distance they were pushed (1d6 impact damage per
10 feet); at the GM’s discretion, the object might also
take damage.
```

###### Stonestance

```
Prerequisite: Vigilant Stance key talent
Activation:
You shift into a solid stance, delivering powerful blows
without giving up ground to the enemy.
When you acquire this talent, you learn a new stance,
which you can enter as :
Stonestance. While in this stance, increase your deflect
value by 1. Additionally, before an enemy within your
melee weapon’s reach spends one or more to attack
one of your allies not in Stonestance, that enemy must
spend one additional.
```

**120** Chapter 4: Heroic Paths

###### Devastating Blow

```
Prerequisite: Athletics 3+; Combat Training talent
Activation:
Delivering a fatal strike requires not only skill, but resolve.
You’ve learned to set aside any natural aversion to harming
others, and when you strike to kill, you do so without
mercy or hesitation.
Make a melee weapon attack against the Physical
defense of a target. When you roll damage for this
attack, add an extra 2d8 damage.
This talent becomes more powerful as your tier
increases: at tier 3, you roll an extra 3d8 damage (instead
of 2d8); at tier 4, you instead roll an extra 4d8 damage;
and at tier 5, you instead roll an extra 5d8 damage.
```

###### Formation Drills

```
Prerequisite: Discipline 2+; Defensive Position talent
Activation:
You coordinate your allies to march in a defensive form-
ation with you.
While an ally within 10 feet of you benefits from the
Brace action, they also benefit from your Defensive
Position as if they had that talent themself.
```

###### Hardy

```
Prerequisite: Combat Training talent
Activation:
You’ve trained your body to endure pain and fatigue,
keeping you in the fight until the bitter end.
When you acquire this talent, your maximum and
current health increase by 1 per level. This applies to all
previous and future levels; for example, if you choose this
talent at level 6, retroactively increase your health by 6.
```

###### Swift Strikes

```
Prerequisite: Hardy talent
Activation:
You instinctively follow the tempo of battle, keeping the
pressure on your foes at critical moments.
Spend 1 focus to make a second Strike action with a
hand you already used for a Strike this turn.
```

###### Wa ry

```
Prerequisite: Discipline 3+; Defensive Position talent
Activation:
Through your experience living in dangerous locations,
you’ve learned to stay focused and respond quickly to
unexpected hazards.
While you have 1 or more focus, you can’t be Surprised.
Additionally, when you resist influence or lose focus
involuntarily, reduce the amount of focus lost by your
ranks in Discipline (to a minimum of 1 focus lost).
```

###### Windstance

```
Prerequisite: Perception 1+; Shard Training talent
Activation:
```

_You adopt a mobile stance that maximizes your area
of attack, delivering wide sweeps that slash across
groups of foes._
When you acquire this talent, you learn a new stance,
which you can enter as :
**Windstance.** While in this stance, you gain an advantage
on Agility tests. Additionally, while there are two or
more enemies within your reach, you can use to
gain , which you can spend only to Disengage or use
an action that includes an attack test targeting one or
more of those enemies.

## CORE RULEBOOK VERSION CORE RULEBOOK VERSION

# TT

```
he ten orders of the ancient Knights
Radiant wielded wondrous powers to protect
humankind. Their members formed bonds
with bits of sapient Investiture known as spren, and
through this powerful symbiosis, each Radiant order
gained access to two of the ten surges—extraordinary
abilities powered by Stormlight. For millennia,
the Knights Radiant used these surges to defend
humankind from cataclysmic events known as
Desolations ... but one day, the Radiants mysteriously
abandoned humankind, forsaking their powers and
leaving their people defenseless on Roshar.
```

#### Using Radiant Paths

```
The Radiant paths in this chapter operate much like
heroic paths, following the rules in the “Using Paths and
Talents” section of chapter 4. However, as described
in the upcoming “Playing a Radiant” section, being a
Knight Radiant carries with it much more responsibility
than merely writing a talent on your character sheet.
```

##### Radiant Path Options

```
This chapter presents nine playable Radiant paths
(along with information about the exceptional tenth
order, the Bondsmiths). Much like each heroic path has
three specialties, each Radiant path grants access to
three talent trees: one for your spren bond, and two for
the surges wielded by your Radiant order. The talents
for each path’s spren bond are presented in this chapter;
meanwhile, chapter 6 details the surge skills and their
corresponding talents.
The upcoming “Orders of Knights Radiant” section
summarizes each order and the talent trees they gain
access to.
```

##### Choosing a First Ideal Talent

```
You must be level 2 or higher to choose a First Ideal
key talent. However, even before you gain a level and
choose that talent, you can talk to your GM about
introducing a Radiant spren to begin forging a bond
with (see “Playing a Radiant” for guidance on attract-
ing a spren, and see “Playing with Spren” for rules on
interacting with them once bonded).
When you do choose your First Ideal talent , this
confirms to the GM that you’re interested in becoming
Radiant in a particular order. However, your character
hasn’t yet “spoken the Words” and sworn that Ideal.
Instead, this talent has two effects: it immediately
grants you access to Investiture, and it grants you
a goal: “Speak the First Ideal.”
```

###### Unlocking Investiture

```
The First Ideal talent represents that you’ve attracted
the attention of a Radiant spren. You immediately
gain access to Investiture in the form of Stormlight,
and along with it, access to three actions: Breathe
Stormlight, Enhance, and Regenerate (see “Stormlight
Actions”).
In addition to healing your body and empowering
your attributes, you’ll eventually be able to use
Investiture to fuel the two surges of your Radiant order
(detailed in chapter 6).
```

###### Unlocking Surges

```
Your First Ideal talent doesn’t immediately grant
access to the surges for your prospective Radiant order.
Instead, as you continue your adventures, you’ll work
toward your new goal, “Speak the First Ideal,” which
you’ll likely complete before you gain your next level.
After you complete that goal, you’re rewarded with
the two surges from your First Ideal talent. See the
upcoming “Playing a Radiant” section for more details
on pursuing this goal.
```

##### Investiture and Stormlight

```
Investiture is the energy that suffuses the cosmere, the
divine essence that powers Invested Arts. Every soul in
the cosmere begins life with some natural Investiture,
but they aren’t usually able to manipulate it. Characters
with an Investiture score have gained the ability to wield
t hat energ y.

Chapter 5: Radiant Paths 123
```

```
JUSTYNA DURA
```

```
During combat, you can use the Breathe Stormlight
action from the next section, draining an infused sphere
and gaining its Stormlight.
You usually start scenes with full Investiture; much
like drawing your weapon before a fight, it’s assumed
that if you’re not Surprised when a scene begins,
you’ve already instinctively used Breathe Stormlight
(no action required). However, if you start a scene with
the Surprised condition, you only start with 1 Invest-
iture—just enough to passively maintain any ongoing
Invested powers.
```

###### Light and Anti-Light

```
During your adventures, you’ll primarily use
Stormlight, but Investiture can also appear in rarer
forms like Lifelight or Voidlight, or even hybrids
like Towerlight.
Each form of Light also has an inverse (such as
anti-Stormlight). These Lights glow differently and
are horribly destructive when they encounter their
opposite. Anti-Light can’t fuel your surges in the same
way Stormlight does; while some people wield weapons
using anti-Light, doing so is extremely dangerous to
them and their spren. Use caution if you encounter
anti-Stormlight in your travels.
```

##### Stormlight Actions

```
In addition to fueling surges, holding Stormlight allows
you to tap into powers like improved healing, improved
strength, and improved speed. When you choose a
First Ideal talent, you gain access to the following three
actions, which follow the usual rules in the “Actions
and Reactions” section of chapter 10.
```

###### Breathe Stormlight ( )

```
You draw Stormlight into yourself from infused spheres
within 5 feet of you; if you have enough spheres, you
recover Investiture up to your maximum.
In normal times, dun spheres can be readily
exchanged for infused spheres, and highstorms occur
regularly. If you have at least three times as many marks
as your Investiture total, it’s assumed you have enough
infused spheres to draw from.
In some situations, the GM may ask you to keep
track of how many of your spheres are infused. On those
occasions, you recover 1 Investiture for each infused
mark or broam you drain.
You can use this action even if you’re Unconscious
or otherwise prevented from using actions.
```

```
On Roshar, Investiture mainly manifests as Storm-
light—the energy that coruscates across the highstorm,
glows within each broam, and gives the Knights Radiant
their wondrous powers.
```

###### Spending Investiture

```
Investiture is a spiritual resource that mechanically
operates much like focus does. For a Radiant character,
Stormlight is your source of Investiture, and your
Investiture pool reflects the amount you can breathe
in and use efficiently.
At character creation, you’ll leave the Investiture field
on your character sheet blank. However, once you’ve
chosen the First Ideal key talent from a Radiant path,
you gain a maximum Investiture score (see “Investiture”
in chapter 3).
You can spend Investiture to activate your surges
and surge talents (presented in chapter 6), along with
your spren bond talents (presented later in this chapter).
Additionally, you can use the three Stormlight actions
in the next section: Breathe Stormlight, Enhance, and
Regenerate.
Investiture also maintains any ongoing Invested
effects that draw on your Stormlight. As a result, if
your current Investiture ever drops to 0, you temporarily
become non-Invested and you can’t maintain your
ongoing Investiture effects (such as infusions) beyond
their remaining durations.
```

###### Regaining Stormlight

```
Roshar is a world rich with Investiture. Most people use
gemstones embedded in glass spheres as currency (see
“Spheres” in chapter 7). Since these spheres effectively
serve as batteries for storing Stormlight, infused spheres
are precious to Radiants.
```

```
GM Tip: Managing Stormlight
Radiant players need spheres to store Investiture in the
form of Stormlight, which they can breathe in to fuel their
powers. While players can keep track of exactly how many
infused and dun spheres they have, only re-infusing them
when they’re in highstorms, tracking this is cumbersome.
You’re encouraged to assume PCs have sufficient
Stormlight to fuel their abilities, as long as they can access
passing highstorms and are carrying wealth in marks equal
to at least three times their Investiture total. Don’t worry
about tracking whether their spheres are technically chips,
marks, or broams (see “Spheres” in chapter 7).
However, if the story causes a PC to lose all their
spheres or not have access to a highstorm for extended
periods, you can increase narrative tension by asking
players to track their infused marks and broams.
```

**124** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

```
strengthening bond and your new ability to control
Investiture.
It’s up to you and your GM to decide how you
interweave the talent’s rules, timing, and narrative.
For example, some players want to continue (or start)
developing their spren bond after they choose the First
Ideal talent; in this case, you can delay your use of Inves-
titure until it fits the narrative, even though your talent
lets you use it sooner.
Regardless of whether you initiate the bonding
process before or after choosing the talent, the GM has
ultimate say over whether you’re successful in advancing
your spren bond. In some situations, you might discover
your personal ideals aren’t well-suited for that order.
```

##### Attracting a Spren

```
“Are windspren attracted to wind,” she asked softly,
“or do they make it?”
Each Knight Radiant gains their abilities through their
spren bond , which scholars call the “Nahel bond.”
This bond is a linking of spirits, a symbiotic relationship
that grants benefits to both partners: the spren gains
the ability to manifest in the Physical Realm without
losing their sapience or memory, and the person gains
Surgebinding and the ability to breathe in Stormlight.
But before this bond can be formed, the spren must first
be drawn to the prospective Radiant.
In general, when you behave in a way that appeals
to a certain type of spren or aligns with the Ideals of
a given order, a Radiant spren can be drawn to you.
Nine common types of Radiant spren can bond with
humans and singers, each corresponding with an order
of Knights Radiant; the tenth Radiant order works a
bit differently. Individual spren vary in motives and
preferences just like people of flesh and blood, but when
selecting prospective Radiants, each type of spren tends
to follow certain patterns (as detailed in the section for
each order).
```

###### You and Your Spren

```
As a player, be open with your GM about what kind of
spren you hope your character will attract (even if your
character isn’t personally aware they’re doing so).
The GM is encouraged to use Radiant spren as
NPCs, communicating when a PC’s heroic actions have
drawn a spren’s attention and approval. However, it can
sometimes be overwhelming for the GM to track all
the different types of spren and whether a character is
behaving in a way that would attract one. You and your
fellow players can help them keep an eye out for times
you specifically embody the Ideals or preferences of a
spren. See the upcoming “Playing with Spren” section
```

###### Enhance (▶)

Spend 1 Investiture to become Enhanced [Strength +1]
and Enhanced [Speed +1] until the end of your next
turn. At the end of that turn and each of your turns
thereafter, you can spend 1 Investiture as to maintain
these conditions until the end of your next turn.

###### Regenerate ( )

Spend 1 Investiture to recover health equal to 1d6 +
your current tier; for example, a tier 2 character recovers
1d6 + 2 health.
You can use this free action even if you’re Uncon-
scious or otherwise prevented from using actions.

#### Playing a Radiant

Once your character reaches level 2 or higher, you might
choose to join one of the orders of the Knights Radiant.
But becoming a Radiant isn’t simply a matter of choosing
the First Ideal key talent and gaining access to powerful
surges. It represents your profound commitment to a set
of Ideals and your growing relationship with a sapient
spren who chooses to bond with you.
This section guides you on using storytelling to
support your relationship with your spren and Radiant
order, both by roleplaying your character and by
collaborating with your GM. It also includes rules
for interacting with your spren.

##### Before Choosing

##### a Radiant Path

Long before you gain a level and choose a First Ideal
talent, it’s a good idea to talk to your GM about your
desire to follow a Radiant path. This helps your GM
give you opportunities to live up to your prospective
order’s Ideals.
Similarly, you don’t have to wait until you choose
the First Ideal talent to start attracting a spren. You
and your GM are encouraged to collaborate earlier
to introduce a Radiant spren to the narrative; when
you later choose the First Ideal talent, it reflects your

and the Spiritual. Even if your physical body is wounded,
your spiritual self may be intact and whole. When you heal
with Investiture, you’re simply transforming your physical
body to match your spiritual one. This may have effects on
your body beyond regaining health; for example, people
who have a different identity or sense of self may see
their bodies transform to match their spiritual identity,
including changing sex and appearance.

Chapter 5: Radiant Paths 125
```

```
Each time you take a step like the above in a dramatic
or narratively satisfying way, ask the GM if you can
mark a milestone box. Additionally, you can mark a
milestone after a significant action that aligns with
your prospective order’s core philosophy (such as “I will
protect” for the Windrunners). You can find each
order’s core philosophy in the upcoming “Orders of
Knights Radiant” section.
```

###### Saying the Words

```
You’ll generally swear an Ideal “on camera” during
a scene, ideally at the climax of a narrative arc. Once
you’ve marked all three milestone boxes, you can
collaborate with your GM to plan a fitting moment—or
when the timing feels right, either you or your GM can
suggest swearing an Ideal during that scene. If you both
agree, the GM prompts you to “speak the Words” for
that Ideal. After you do so, the GM replies that “these
Words are accepted,” and your goal is complete.
```

```
for more suggestions on developing and depicting your
relationship with your spren.
On You r Character Sheet. Once you’ve attracted
a Radiant spren (whether before or after choosing your
first Radiant talent), you can record their name and type
in the “Connections” section of your character sheet.
```

##### Swearing Ideals

```
Each Radiant order has five Ideals , as described in
each order’s section. These immortal Words are their
ethos and creed, guiding the members of that order in
everything they do.
Once you speak an Ideal, you must continue follow-
ing it, and forsaking it can have dire consequences. But
swearing an Ideal isn’t as simple as saying a few words
out loud. You must understand the Words and feel their
meaning and purpose deep in your soul—a process that
takes much time, growth, and dedication.
```

###### Ideals and Goals

```
This game tracks your progression through each Ideal
via special Ideal goals (see chapter 8), which you
acquire from the corresponding Ideal talent from your
Radiant path.
Starting with the First Ideal, you’ll work toward
your current goal by embodying the philosophy of your
Radiant order. As you achieve significant personal
milestones, the GM will have you mark milestone boxes
on your character sheet (see “Progressing the First
Ideal” for example milestones).
Once you’ve marked all three milestone boxes
toward your Ideal goal, the rules of your talent allow
you to speak the Words—but you might want to wait
until a particularly fitting moment in the story (see
the upcoming “Saying the Words” section).
```

###### Progressing the First Ideal

```
While each Radiant order swears different oaths,
they all share the First Ideal : “Life before death.
Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.”
Interpretations of these Words vary, but every Radiant
who swears this oath is committing to personal growth
in the service of others.
Once you choose your First Ideal key talent, you’ll
need to progress your new goal over time. For example,
you might:
```

◆ (^) Prioritize saving lives over causing death.
◆ (^) Display great physical, mental, or emotional fortitude
amid enormous challenges—especially ones relating
to the obstacle you chose during character creation.
◆ (^) Stay present in the moment and focus on the tasks
and people in front of you, rather than on ambitions
in the distant future.

###### Swearing Higher Ideals

```
To gain some of the most important and iconic Radiant
abilities—such as a Shardblade—you must first swear
higher Ideals. Once you’re ready for your character
to work toward the next Ideal (and once you meet the
prerequisites for that talent in your spren bond tree),
you can choose that talent when you level up.
Like your First Ideal talent, your new Ideal talent
doesn’t immediately grant all its benefits; instead, you
gain a new goal that’ll eventually allow you to swear
its Ideal.
As you work toward your three milestones for each
new Ideal goal, this represents strengthening your spren
bond while enduring hardship, demonstrating growth
toward your Ideal to become worthy of it. Like you did
for the First Ideal, when your actions exemplify this new
goal, ask your GM about marking another milestone box.
```

Each time you complete an Ideal goal, your character
bursts alight with power! As stated in each Ideal’s talent,
you become Empowered until the end of the current
scene, and you unlock any remaining benefits from
that talent.

###### Swearing the First Ideal

When you swear the First Ideal, your character commits
to an order of the Knights Radiant. Completing this
goal unlocks the remaining benefits from your First
Ideal talent: you become Empowered and gain access
to your order’s two surge skills.
**On You r Character Sheet.** When you complete
your First Ideal goal, write the names of your order’s
two surges on the blank lines beneath your list of skills;
you gain a free skill rank in both of these surge skills.
As your character gains levels, you can advance your
surge skills like any other skill.

**second ideal Third ideal fourTh ideal**

```
Chapter 5: Radiant Paths 127
```

```
When you’re ready, you again speak the Words during
a scene (see the earlier “Saying the Words” section),
unlocking a new ability for that Ideal. The “Philosophy”
section for your Radiant order suggests ways to advance
your higher Ideal goals.
For higher Ideals, the Words differ for each person
and order. Some orders have more structured themes,
while others are entirely personalized for each Radiant.
The section for your order outlines the customary oaths
and ideas behind each Ideal; however, feel free to
creatively shape your own Words to match your
character, so long as they still represent the core
philosophies of the Ideal.
```

###### Forsaking Your Ideals

```
When you join an order, you’re swearing to follow its
Ideals your entire life, embodying and living them to the
best of your ability. If you start to act against your oaths,
this can damage the bond with your spren, causing you
to lose access to the surges and potentially even killing
your spren:
```

◆ (^) The first time you act against your Ideals, nothing
occurs. No one is perfect, and mistakes can
be forgiven.
◆ (^) If you act against your Ideals a second time before
demonstrably advancing your Ideals, your bond
weakens: you lose access to your highest Ideal and its
benefits, and you lose access to any talents with that
Ideal as a prerequisite.
◆ (^) These losses continue each time your actions do,
removing your highest remaining Ideal talent until
you have none left.
◆ (^) After this, continually breaking your oath will
permanently bar you from that order’s path and
talents. If you had a particularly strong bond with
your spren, doing so can severely hurt or even kill
your spren.
Before it gets that far though, you can repair your bond!
If you prove that you’re once again dedicated to your
Ideals and that your infractions are behind you, you
reverse any damage to your spren bond. It’s up to you
and your GM to decide what this looks like for you, but
rededicating yourself to your Ideals is a personal choice
that goes much deeper than lip service.

##### Squires

```
Once you speak the Third Ideal, you can choose the
Take Squire talent. This allows you to designate trusted
allies as squires , granting them a portion of your
Radiant powers without them needing to bond spren.
```

###### Gaining Your Own Squires

```
When the Take Squire talent grants you the ability to
take on squires, you can do so with NPCs you know
and trust. If you gain a companion as a reward (see
“Companions” in chapter 8), you can make them a
squire and grant the Squire ability described below.
Squires aren’t limited to companions; even a non-
Radiant player character can become your squire,
if they so wish.
```

###### Squire Ability

```
For an NPC or player character to become a squire,
they must have spent enough time with their Radiant to
form a bond of trust, and they must already benefit from
the Radiant’s mentorship or training in more mundane
ways. This bond of trust isn’t formed lightly and can
take a lot of time—or extreme circumstances.
Each player character or NPC who is chosen as
a Radiant’s squire gains the following ability:
Squire. While within 50 miles of the Radiant who made
you their squire, you have the ability to draw Stormlight,
you have an Investiture maximum of 2, and you can use
the Breathe Stormlight, Enhance, and Regenerate actions.
Additionally, when your Radiant makes you their squire, they
can choose to give you access to one or both of their surges,
including 1 rank in each surge skill; these last for as long as
you are their squire. You don’t gain access to any of their
Radiant talents, and during character advancement, you
can’t gain ranks in those surge skills.
You stop being this Radiant’s squire if you choose to,
if your Radiant dismisses you, if you become a squire to
another Radiant, or if you bond a Radiant spren and gain
your own Radiant abilities.
```

```
The Fifth Ideal
Only a handful of modern Knights Radiant have sworn
the Fourth Ideal. While each order of Radiants has a Fifth
Ideal, it hasn’t been spoken by any living person for over
two thousand years. These Words are lost to time, and
characters in this game can’t achieve it (yet).
```

```
Switching First Ideal Talents
On your journey to speaking the First Ideal, you or the GM
might conclude your character isn’t compatible with the
philosophy of the order you initially wanted to join. If you’ve
already chosen a First Ideal talent when that happens, you
can switch your current First Ideal talent after a long rest,
instead choosing a different order that may be a better fit.
From a narrative perspective, this attracts a Radiant spren
of a different type. However, when you switch, you can
keep any milestones you’ve already recorded toward your
“Speak the First Ideal” goal.
```

###### Playing as a Squire

If you have a patron who is themself a Radiant of the
Third Ideal or higher, or if another player character
decides to take you on as their squire, you can become
a Radiant squire. To do so, you must have spent enough
time with them to form a bond of trust, as detailed in
the previous section. Your GM decides when you’ve
forged a bond strong enough to be taken on as a squire.

##### Playing With Spren

You r **spren** is both an extension of your character and
an individual in their own right. Feel free to roleplay
both sides of the partnership between your character
and their spren—but at times, the GM may speak
through your spren, maybe even sharing information
that you and your character don’t know. If you break
your oaths and the bond with your spren begins to fray,
they become a GM-controlled NPC (see the earlier
“Forsaking your Ideals” section).
In this way, roleplaying a spren is a joint effort
between you and the GM. Together, you shape the
personality of your spren. The section for your order
describes the spren associated with it, but each spren is
unique, and discovering your spren’s personality through
play can be a very fun and rewarding experience.

###### Spren Rules

```
Your spren doesn’t have a stat block and they don’t take
turns of their own; instead, they serve more as a force of
nature who can act whenever it suits the shared story.
```

###### Movement

```
In combat, your spren can move up to your movement
rate each round, ignoring terrain penalties when they do.
A newly bonded spren temporarily loses their sapience if
they move out of your spren bond range —this range
begins at 30 feet, but you can increase it further with
the Deepened Bond talent.
```

###### Interacting With Your Spren

```
In general, your spren is invisible and inaudible to other
people, but this varies between spren, as described in
the section for each Radiant order. Even if your spren
is inaudible to others, you can’t hear their voice unless
they’re reasonably close to you (or have the ability to
communicate telepathically).
You generally need to speak aloud to communicate
with your spren, which can potentially reveal your
position to other characters. However, once you speak
the Third Ideal and can manifest your spren as a
Radiant Shardblade, you can carry on silent telepathic
conversations while touching them.
```

```
When you give your spren a specific task, such as
answering a difficult question or doing something to
assist you, the GM may require you to spend some focus
to gain a benefit from the interaction. This reflects the
fact that spren aren’t creatures of the Physical Realm;
they may have difficulty understanding or explaining
concepts, requiring additional attention on your part.
```

###### Spren Abilities

```
You can spend the indicated focus and actions to allow
your spren to use the following abilities:
Covert Scouting (Costs 2 Focus). Over several minutes,
your spren stealthily scouts an area within your spren bond
range, then reports back on what they observed. To glean
certain information from this report, the GM might require
you to make an Awareness skill test against a DC they set.
or Oath Encouragement (Costs 2 Focus). When you
face hardship, your spren encourages you to find the best in
yourself and live up to your Ideals. You gain an advantage on
your next test to face self-doubt, fear, or anything else that
stems from your obstacle.
Sudden Warning (Costs 3 Focus). When you’re imperiled,
your spren can alert you to imminent danger (no action
required). At the GM’s discretion, this can allow you to ignore
the effects of the Surprised condition or otherwise react to
a threat you didn’t detect.
Translation (Costs 2 Focus). For the next minute, your
spren helps you communicate by translating spoken and
signed Rosharan languages (including Rosharan Shadesmar).
During this time, characters who know at least one Rosharan
language can understand you, and you can understand any
Rosharan language you don’t normally know. Alternatively,
you can use this ability to have your spren read aloud one
page of text that’s written in a Rosharan language you
can’t read.
Each type of spren has other unique abilities, described
in the entry for the corresponding Radiant order. Your
spren can also gain abilities from your spren bond
talents, and you and your GM are welcome to create
other abilities together.
```

#### Orders of Knights Radiant

```
The ancient Knights Radiant were a group dedicated
to protecting Roshar during the Desolations—the
cataclysms where Odium’s forces returned to wreak
havoc and destroy human society—and in the times
in between, to rebuild. After the Last Desolation
thousands of years ago, the knights forswore their
oaths in an event called the Recreance. The power
of Surgebinding was lost, and only legends remained
of the Radiants and their betrayal of humanity.
```

```
In the modern era, these legendary powers were
rediscovered when spren began to feel a new Desolation
coming, and people began to forge new spren bonds.
Some modern Radiants have banded together like the
knights of old, reforming the ten ancient orders. These
orders are each defined by the spren they bond, the
Ideals they follow, and thereby the surges they command.
As a player character, you can choose between nine
Radiant orders; the tenth, the Order of Bondsmiths,
can only have three Radiants at any given time.
However, not all Radiants have joined together in
these formal orders; a few prefer to work alone. These
independent Radiants still adhere to their Ideals, but
they don’t observe an order’s traditions or hierarchy.
The Radiant Orders table summarizes the ten orders,
then the following sections (presented in alphabetical
order) go into greater detail on their philosophies,
history, and spren.
```

```
Bonding Multiple Radiant Spren
Though incredibly uncommon, it’s possible to bond
multiple Radiant spren—either two of the same type, or
even two of different types. While each PC can usually
only join one Radiant path, you and your GM can make an
exception if it fits the story. For each spren bond, you must
speak and maintain new oaths as described below.
Same Type of Spren. If you’re bonding a second spren
of the same type as your existing spren bond, you don’t
need to choose your existing Ideal talents a second time,
but you must once again progress through your Ideal
goals and speak the Ideals in a unique way under new
circumstances, reflecting how you’ve changed since you
swore the oaths a previous time. Any future Ideals you
swear can count toward all your spren bonds of that type—
though each spren must accept the Words.
Once you complete the goal “Speak the Third Ideal,”
you can summon two of your spren who accepted those
Words, allowing you to dual-wield Radiant Shardblades,
and you can summon both of them using a single Interact
action.
Different Type of Spren. If you’re bonding a second
spren of a different type, you must start from the very
beginning of that order’s path by choosing its First Ideal
key talent and progressing each Ideal goal as usual.
Once you’ve attained the Third Ideal with both your
original path and the new one, you can summon both
spren as dual-wielded Radiant Shardblades, and you
can summon both using a single Interact action.
The inherent contradictions of many orders’ philo-
sophies make it nearly impossible to maintain both
bonds, so few Radiants attempt to bond multiple spren.

```
A barefoot Dustbringer skates along the ground as if it were
ice, fleeing from the pursuing soldiers. Finally clear of the
civilian casualty zone, she whips around and unleashes
a gout of flame to devastate her enemy.
Sliding across the atrium, a Dustbringer erodes the top
layer of the floor in their wake and kicks up the resulting dust.
They slip beyond the cloud, collect the innocents cowering
behind an overturned table, and guide them to safety.
With patient strokes of his fingers, a Dustbringer shaves
down the metal ingot under the attentive watch of his
ashspren partner. There! It’s finally the exact shape he
needed to repair the broken heatrial; its owners will be
comfortable in this brutal winter.
Dustbringers enjoy engineering and taking things apart
to learn how they work. The surges of Division and
Abrasion make them incredibly hard to pin down, giving
them a great advantage as mobile artillery and sappers
on the battlefield. Division allows them to selectively
decay and destroy, whether by disabling war machines,
rending the air into flame, or destroying weapons,
armor, and structures. With Abrasion, they can make
any part of themselves frictionless, enabling them to
slip, slide, and dodge at incredible speeds.
```

##### Dustbringer Philosophy

```
“I will seek self-mastery.”
The Order of Dustbringers can seem the most contra-
dictory of the Radiant orders. They wield enormous
destructive powers and both Dustbringers and ashspren
alike tend to enjoy breaking things down to see how they
work—but at its core, the philosophy of the Dustbringers
is that those with great power must have even greater
disc ipline. Just as their powers must be properly chan-
neled and shaped, so must their own desires and wills.
```

```
Dustbringers strive to avoid civilian casualties in even
the largest conflicts, and as a rule, they spurn people
who only value their destructive potential. Between the
speed and mobility from Abrasion and the decay and
annihilation of Division, Dustbringers are the Radiant
order capable of the greatest destruction. However,
they define themselves by their control, precision, and
understanding, and this is reflected in their Ideals.
Beyond the First Ideal (see “Swearing Ideals” earlier
in this chapter), each Ideal is designed to teach the true
nature of power—both literal and figurative—along with
what it means to possess power and the responsibilities
that power brings. While each individual Dustbringer’s
Ideals are personal to their own journey and involve
their own specific Words, they tend to follow certain
patterns. The sections below suggest common phrases
you can use to inspire your own oaths.
```

###### The Second Ideal

```
“To control my power, I will control myself.”
The Second Ideal focuses on self-mastery. Each
Dustbringer has their own desires and wills, but this
oath channels all toward a greater purpose. This is less
about changing yourself and what you want, and more
about demonstrating your discipline to constructively
direct your desires—thereby proving you can be trusted
to do the same with your destructive Surgebinding
potential. Traditionally, a Dustbringer doesn’t gain
the surge of Division until they’ve sworn this Ideal
(see the “GM Tip: Dustbringers and Canon” sidebar
later in this entry).
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Second
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Demonstrate restraint, especially relating to your
purpose and obstacle. If you’re usually impulsive,
you must work not to act on your impulses. If you’re
usually careless in how your actions harm others, you
must become more cognizant of the consequences
your actions have beyond yourself. In moments of
emotion and passion, channel them in a controlled
and deliberate way.
**Recommended Heroic Paths for Dustbringers**
Dustbringers are highly mobile, with a penchant for
crafting and engineering. They also have a reputation for
being thrill-seekers who dive headfirst into any situation.
As such, the following heroic paths can be excellent
precursors to the Dustbringer Radiant path:
◆ (^) Agent (Investigator or Thief)
◆ (^) Hunter (Archer, Assassin, or Tracker)
◆ (^) Scholar (Artifabrian or Strategist)

### Dustbringer

###### Radiant Path

**132** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

###### The Third Ideal

```
“To understand my power, I will understand what power is.”
Now that you’ve shown through the Second Ideal
that you can master yourself, the Third Ideal begins
your journey to the mastery of power itself. You must
understand not only the Surgebinding powers you wield,
but also other types of power: political position, societal
echelon, wealth, physical aptitude, charisma, knowledge,
and other avenues of influence.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Third
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Bear witness to the effects of various types of power.
How do leaders control those under their command?
How do merchants and nobles wield wealth to get
what they want? How do Shardbearers and Radiants
exert their influence? What privileges do
lighteyed people claim over darkeyed ones?
◆ (^) Examine your own powers. Beyond
Surgebinding, what types of power do you
hold, and what privileges do they afford you?

###### The Fourth Ideal

```
Though the specific words are individualized for each
Dustbringer, the Fourth Ideal requires acknowledgment
that all power is accompanied by obligation, and that
ignoring your responsibility can have dire consequences.
For Radiants, obligation means literally following oaths,
but even a monarch is responsible for serving their
people, and there are rules that even gods must follow.
When those with influence fail to match it with
responsibility, shockwaves extend as far as the power
that person wields. As a powerful Dustbringer, you
have a duty to serve the common person and do as
little harm as possible.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the
Fourth Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Examine the ways you’ve seen power abused.
What should’ve been the duties of holding that
power, and how were those duties failed?
◆ (^) Consider the powers you wield, including any
you’ve gained since speaking the Third Ideal.
What responsibilities do each of your sources of
power require of you? How do they conflict with
your purpose or obstacle?
◆ (^) Reflect on the times you’ve failed to properly
uphold your obligations. What consequences did
your failures bring for you and others? What harm
did you cause, intentionally or not, and how could
you have avoided it? If you gain greater power, what
responsibilities might it bring and how will you
manage them?
_We all bear the capacity for unimaginable
damage and destruction. The only way to
protect those around us is to always maintain
a firm, unshakeable control over ourselves._
Chapter 5: Radiant Paths **133**
STEVE PRESCOTT

##### Dustbringer History

```
In the days of the old Radiants, Dustbringers served as
sappers, engineers, and strategists, though their primary
military use was razing earth and causing widespread
destruction. As the Desolations grew more frequent
and horrible leading up to the Recreance, the ancient
Dustbringers became increasingly concerned that they
were valued purely for their powers of annihilation.
Some Radiant orders—particularly the Skybreakers—
considered Dustbringers to walk the edge of evil and
distrusted them greatly. The Dustbringers eventually
attempted to abandon their order’s name due to its
similarity to “Voidbringer”; instead, they encouraged
others to call them the Order of Releasers.
In the modern era, very few Dustbringers are known.
The first of these was Malata and her ashspren Spark;
she arrived with the King of Kharbranth, Taravangian,
when he joined the Coalition of Monarchs. Unknown
to the rest of the coalition, Taravangian and Malata
were both members of the Diagram, a secretive group
who sought to predict the future to protect Kharbranth.
They betrayed the coalition to side with Odium, who
they believed would win the war. Malata’s betrayal
was motivated in part by her spren Spark, who seeks
vengeance against the refounded Knights Radiant on
behalf of all the ashspren who died in the Recreance.
However, not all modern Dustbringers have sided
with Odium. Ral-na, king of the Reshi community
that lives atop the seafaring greatshell Relu-na, has also
bonded an ashspren. He led a Reshi delegation to visit
Dalinar Kholin at Urithiru, hoping to learn more about
his powers and to open talks of alliance. Despite these
glimmers of hope, the damage of Malata’s betrayal is
done, and many modern Radiants view Dustbringers
with the same suspicion as did the Radiants of old.
However, if you confront these shadows head-on, you
might be able to change this perception and prove your
loyalty to the Coalition of Monarchs.
```

##### Ashspren

```
To become a Dustbringer, you must bond with an
ashspren—but most ashspren never forgave humanity
for the hundreds of spren that were killed during the
Recreance.
```

###### Ashspren Appearance

```
Within the Cognitive Realm, ashspren are humanoids
with ashen-white skin. Their hair appears as thin
strands of ash or smoke that billow easily in the wind
or stream behind them as they move. When their
skin stretches or meets resistance, it briefly collapses
into dust particles that blow away, revealing the bone
beneath, then their flesh reforms. Ashspren often take
advantage of this to direct a scornful gesture toward
humans: they use their thumb to flick away their lower
lip and expose their teeth in a sneer.
Ashspren appear in the Physical Realm as a branch-
ing network of faintly glowing electrical scorches. They
can’t alter their appearance, but as an ashspren moves
across a surface or within an object, their branches
“grow” along it, creating an illusion that they’re burning
toward their destination. After they pass, the trail of
cracks disappears without causing harm.
```

###### Ashspren Culture

```
Scholars know little about ashspren culture, though
many ashspren sail the bead oceans of Shadesmar
or cohabitate with other spren within the cities of
the Cognitive Realm. Their shroud of mystery may
be due to the near-universal hostility that these
spren feel toward humans, especially Radiants,
for killing ashspren. This ancient animosity drives
some to form a Nahel bond with a person who is
likely to join Odium’s forces and oppose the modern
Radiants, but most simply choose to avoid people
and Voidbringers alike.

##### Dustbringer Key Talent

```
When a Dustbringer completes their goal from the First
Ideal key talent, this unlocks access to the Ashspren
Bond talent tree (in this chapter) and the Abrasion
and Division talent trees (in chapter 6).
```

###### First Ideal (Dustbringer Key)

```
Prerequisite: Level 2+
Activation:
You begin bonding an ashspren, allowing you to breathe

###### Ashspren Names

Many ashspren names reference phenomena related
to fire, such as Blaze, Charcoal, Cinder, Ember, Flare,
Inferno, Pyre, Sear, Scorch, and Smoke.

###### Earning a Bond

In the days of the ancient Knights Radiant, ashspren
typically sought bonds with people who shared their
fascination with learning how things work. They
especially preferred those with a propensity for breaking
things to examine their internal workings. As a result,
most Dustbringers were recruited from tinkerers,
craftspeople, and reverse-engineers.
In the modern era, most ashspren still haven’t
forgiven humans for the Recreance, and many are more
inclined to bond with a maladjusted or angry person
who could likely be convinced to work against the
modern Radiants. However, there may still be individual
ashspren more inclined to the ancient ways, looking for
scholars (esp ecially engineers and artifabrians), crafters,
and foolhardy (but brave) soldiers who try to mitigate
the destruction of war and protect the lives and property
of innocents.

```
Roleplaying an Ashspren
The “Playing with Spren” section provides general
guidance on interacting with your spren. If you bond
with an ashspren, also consider the following.
Perceivability. An ashspren can make themself
visible and audible to whomever they wish; otherwise,
ashspren in the Physical Realm are generally invisible and
inaudible to physical entities who don’t have a specific
ability to perceive spren.
Physical Interaction. Ashspren are nearly incorporeal
in the Physical Realm. They can’t pass through objects,
but they can press themselves completely flat against
surfaces, enabling them to pass through almost any
gap that’s at least a handspan long, even if its width
is razor-thin.
or Te s t Assistance (Costs 1 Focus). Your spren
uses their knowledge and experiences to grant you an
advantage on a specific test. Typically, ashspren can help
with setting traps, dismantling objects, Crafting tests, and
Lore tests related to topics they’re familiar with, though
your spren may be able to help in additional ways.

orary injury, or spend 3 Investiture to recover from a
permanent one.
```

```
GM Tip: Dustbringers and Canon
Within the Stormlight Archive books, Dustbringers can’t
access the surge of Division until at least the Second Ideal.
If your group wishes to emulate this element of canon in
your own game, you can add a Second Ideal prerequisite to
the surge of Division and each Division talent.
If you implement this prerequisite, the First Ideal talent
for Dustbringers grants the following Focus Increase
instead of granting Division:
Focus Increase. When you complete this goal, your
maximum and current focus increase by a number
equal to half your tier (rounded up); for example, if
you’re tier 1 or 2, your focus increases by 1. When your
tier increases, increase your maximum and current
focus accordingly.

BEN MCSWEENEY & DARREN CALVERT
```

```
A blur skates through the conflict—and behind her, her
cultivationspren partner follows in a line of crystal-studded
vines. The Edgedancer slides over obstacles and through
narrow gaps as enemies futilely slash at the air in her wake.
Everywhere she glides, allies’ wounds knit, glowing with
Stormlight, while enemies find themselves with cuts and
bruises they scarcely have time to register.
Above the collapsed staircase, injured people cry from
the second floor. An Edgedancer produces a vinebud seed
from his pocket, infusing it with Stormlight to create a
burst of tendrils leading to the upper level. After nimbly
climbing the vines, he heals the wounded, ushers them to
safety, and moves on to the next house.
An Edgedancer prepares the community center for
the next group of residents seeking support and solace.
The recent battle was brutal, and the people of this town
lost so many loved ones. The very least the knight can
do is give them the space to talk and grieve in a safe
environment.
An Edgedancer’s core duty is to provide service and
assistance to the common people. These Radiants
generally prefer to avoid combat, instead using their
surges of Abrasion and Progression to perform triage for
the wounded, rescue the trapped, and create cover for
noncombatants. However, when necessary, Edgedancers
reveal their deadly grace, vexing their opponents with
their speed, literal slipperiness, and ability to grow
obstacles and cages from plants.
```

##### Edgedancer Philosophy

```
“I will remember.”
Amid war, it’s all too easy to slip into tunnel vision,
to pay attention only to important people, and to
seek emotional distance by abstracting the costs and
casualties. When leaders and Radiants lose sight of the
lives and livelihoods behind those numbers, it can have
disastrous consequences for the ordinary people with
no voice in the war room. An Edgedancer’s most sacred
duty is to advocate and care for these common people—
the working class and the “expendable” foot soldiers—
and to remind the powerful who they truly serve.
Edgedancers tend to ignore high society. In return,
members of the upper crust tend to look on them with
disdain. The order generally avoids battle, instead
healing, rescuing, and triaging. Edgedancers provide
care even for their enemies, since enemy combatants
are also people with full lives who others intentionally
ignore. However, Edgedancers do fight and kill if they
feel they have no other choice.
Beyond the First Ideal (see “Swearing Ideals” earlier
in this chapter), each centers around remembering
and serving the people others overlook, whether
friend or foe.
While each Edgedancer expresses the Words in
their own way, they tend to follow certain patterns.
The sections below suggest common phrases you
can use to inspire your own oaths.
```

```
Recommended Heroic Paths for Edgedancers
Edgedancers come from all walks of life, though they must
care more about service to and advocacy for the common
folk than they do for impressing the powerful. Those
most attracted to the order often grew up destitute or
similarly understand what it is to struggle, and religious
practitioners, doctors, and other civil servants often find
themselves attracted to the order. As such, the following
heroic paths can be excellent precursors to the Edged-
ancer Radiant path:
```

◆ (^) Agent (Thief)
◆ (^) Envoy (Diplomat, Faithful, or Mentor)
◆ (^) Hunter (Tracker)
◆ (^) Leader (Champion)
◆ (^) Scholar (Surgeon)

### Edgedancer

###### Radiant Path

**140** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

###### The Second Ideal

```
“I will remember those who have been forgotten.”
Both in battle and everyday life, many people slip
through the cracks: those with no family, the low-
ranking, the destitute, the imprisoned, the enslaved,
the sick, the dying. The Second Ideal obligates you to
bear witness to these people’s lives. Even when everyone
else has forgotten, an Edgedancer remembers. When
an Edgedancer strikes down an enemy, the Radiant
often pauses to learn their foe’s name and final words,
carrying on their memory.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Second
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Seek out people on society’s fringes and carry their
memory with you. Learn as much as you can about
them—their name, their needs, their desires—and
care for them without assumptions or judgment.
◆ (^) Consistently take notes about people’s lives, their
needs, and how you helped (or were unable to help);
keep these accessible for your character.

###### The Third Ideal

```
“I will listen to those who have been ignored.”
Even within the boundaries of society and community,
leaders and politicians often serve their own interests
over the needs of their people. As such, laborers,
farmers, tradespeople, foot soldiers, and others with
more “pedestrian” occupations are often ignored. The
Third Ideal teaches you to watch for people in distress
and lend them a kind ear, including those whose needs
aren’t outwardly visible.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Third
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Seek out people who have unmet needs—a farmer
suffering a blight, a person trapped in a toxic
domestic situation, a suffering person who longs for
an empathetic ear. Listen to stories like these with
kindness and patience, making them feel heard and
seen. Afterward, do what you can to aid them or
connect them with someone who can better serve
their needs. Even if you can’t personally help, the act
of listening and making them feel heard is invaluable.
◆ (^) Continue to take notes about people’s lives, their
needs, and how you helped (or were unable to help).

###### The Fourth Ideal

```
For the previous two oaths, you learned to seek,
remember, and listen. Though the specific words of the
Fourth Ideal are individualized for each Edgedancer,
this oath progresses you into advocacy: carrying ordinary
people’s concerns to those with power to address them.
You likely haven’t been able to help everyone you’ve
come across, but as an Edgedancer, you can give them
a voice. This Ideal obligates you to do so.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Fourth
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Cultivate alliances with powerful individuals who can
address needs on a larger scale than you could alone:
politicians, high-ranking officers, monarchs, advisors,
and others positioned near the top of their society.
◆ (^) Review your notes about people you couldn’t help
while working toward the Second and Third Ideals—
then leverage your new connections to provide the
help you couldn’t before.
◆ (^) Through speaking with those affected, identify a
systemic problem that disproportionately harms the
common folk, and seek to change it. You might not
succeed, but work until your cultivationspren feels
you’ve done all you can.
Chapter 5: Radiant Paths **141**
STEVE PRESCOTT

##### Edgedancer History

```
Prior to the Recreance, the Edgedancers were perhaps
the least militant of the Knights Radiant, even in
wartime. Unlike many orders, Edgedancers weren’t
organized as a larger military force. They spread
out their members, so most sizable settlements had
at least one Edgedancer on permanent assignment,
proportional to the local population. Within those
towns and cities, Edgedancers provided Regrowth
healing and worked for the common good, sometimes
serving as counselors or spiritual leaders depending on
their personal strengths. These Radiants were beloved
by the common people for their care and grace. Even
members of high society begrudgingly admitted that
Edgedancers numbered among the most graceful,
refined, and well-spoken of Radiants.
During the Desolations, most Edgedancers remained
at their stations in case of Voidbringer attack, but some
instead served as scouts, medics, or special forces
alongside Windrunners or Skybreakers. Thanks to the
combination of speed, agility, and near-indestructibility
granted by Edgedancer surges, other Radiant orders
viewed them with much respect. However, the Edge -
dancer tendency to elevate ordinary people’s needs
above direct commands occasionally chafed other
orders. For example, when the ancient Radiants
abandoned their capital city Urithiru, the Edgedancers
prioritized relocating the displaced populace, while
other orders focused on recording messages in the gem
archive (which modern Radiants discovered thousands
of years later). These tendencies caused some leaders
and strategists to feel that the Edgedancers were too
ignorant of the bigger picture.
It’s believed that a young thief, Lift, is the first
person to bond a cultivationspren in the thousands
of years since the Recreance. She grew up on the
streets of Rall Elorim, then began traveling Roshar
as a young teen. Lift survived by infiltrating wealthy
domiciles to steal a bite of their dinner, taking nothing
else. During her adventures, she found herself in the
Valley of the Nightwatcher—but when Lift sought a
blessing, the Shard Cultivation herself attended to
Lift’s request. Lift asked to remain herself even when
everything else goes wrong, and Cultivation granted
her unique and powerful abilities. From the perspective
of the cultivationspren council known as the Ring
(see “Cultivationspren Culture”), this was a sign of
Cultivation’s favor, so the Ring sent the spren Wyndle
to bond Lift and make her an Edgedancer.
```

```
Since Lift, the Ring has chosen other individuals
as Edgedancer candidates, and the order is steadily
growing in size. All known Edgedancers serve the
Coalition of Monarchs at Urithiru under Dalinar
Kholin’s command.
```

##### Cultivationspren

```
To become an Edgedancer, you must form a bond with
a cultivationspren.
```

###### Cultivationspren Appearance

```
In the Cognitive Realm, cultivationspren take a
humanoid form, one of tightly interwoven vines
that imitate musculature. In some cases, these vines
have a subtle texture reminiscent of rough cloth,
but cultivationspren don’t form clothing as part of
their essence. Their eyes and teeth are translucent
crystal; their hands are also crystalline, though with
the flexibility and mobility of flesh. On the crown of
their heads and throughout their vine-like hair, most
cultivationspren sport additional crystal growths.
While in the Physical Realm, a cultivationspren
appears as a small network of vines speckled with
smooth quartz. They “grow” rapidly in the direction
of their movement, their trail turning crystalline then
dissipating into dust. When conversing, they often curl
and contort their form to resemble a face, though they
needn’t do so to speak.
```

###### Cultivationspren Culture

```
Unlike many other sapient spren, cultivationspren
don’t have their own nation or cities within Shadesmar.
Instead, they live among other spren cultures, often
working as gardeners. This “gardening” generally
involves manifesting objects from soul beads and
artfully arranging them to create elaborate structural
installations. Many cultivationspren specialize their
gardening around a particular type of object, such as
tables, chairs, or doors.
Most cultivationspren also adorn themselves in the
fashions of the Physical Realm, though sometimes worn
differently than in the clothing’s culture of origin.
Despite having no geographic cultural center,
cultivationspren are led by a government council known
as the Ring. In the modern era, the Ring selects people
they believe would be worthy Edgedancers and sends
particular cultivationspren to bond them.
```

**142** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

```
Roleplaying a Cultivationspren
The “Playing with Spren” section provides general
guidance on interacting with your spren. If you bond with
a cultivationspren, also consider the following.
Perceivability. A cultivationspren can make themself
visible and audible to whomever they wish; otherwise, cul-
tivationspren in the Physical Realm are generally invisible
and inaudible to physical entities who don’t have a specific
ability to perceive spren. However, when cultivationspren
move, their crystalline vines are temporarily visible before
collapsing to dust, making stealthy movement difficult.
Physical Interaction. Cultivationspren are nearly
incorporeal in the Physical Realm. They can’t pass through
objects, but they’re made of thin vines, enabling them to
pass through gaps with a diameter of 1 inch.
or Te s t Assistance (Costs 1 Focus). Your spren
uses their knowledge and experiences to grant you an
advantage on a specific test. Typically, cultivationspren
can help with finding common ground or similarly
understanding someone you don’t share a culture or
language with (though they must still speak at least one
language), Insight tests, and Lore tests related to topics
they’re familiar with, though your spren may be able to
help in additional ways.
```

###### Cultivationspren Names

```
The names of cultivationspren are often inspired
by natural phenomena, especially plant life, though
others use ancient naming conventions long-forgotten
to Roshar’s physical denizens. Fitting names include
Althaine, Floriana, Glykis, Hedera, Hortus, Phyllium,
Pollene, Typh, Verdo, and Vlanala.
```

###### Earning a Bond

```
While other spren usually regard Nahel bonds and the
return of the Radiants with some degree of caution
or even hostility, most cultivationspren seem outright
excited. Some cultivationspren don’t choose their
bond partners individually. Instead, the Ring deter-
mines these assignments, preferring people with deep
empathy or who foster other life (such as caretakers,
farmers, and doctors). The Ring also prioritizes those
people they believe are favored by the Blessed Mother,
Cultivation, who all cultivationspren revere.
```

##### Edgedancer Key Talent

```
When an Edgedancer completes their goal from the
First Ideal key talent, this unlocks access to the Culti-
vationspren Bond talent tree (in this chapter) and the
Abrasion and Progression talent trees (in chapter 6).
```

Recommended Heroic Paths for Elsecallers
While the Order of Elsecallers accepts all who genuinely
wish to improve themselves, the order’s combination
of surges is particularly powerful in the hands of a quick
and strategic mind. It also appeals to those who wish to
aid others in journeys of self-improvement. As such, the
following heroic paths can be excellent precursors to the
Elsecaller Radiant path:
```

◆ (^) Agent (Investigator)
◆ (^) Envoy (Faithful or Mentor)
◆ (^) Leader (Officer)
◆ (^) Scholar (Strategist or Surgeon)
◆ (^) Warrior (Soldier)
_With a thunderous crash, a boulder breaches the perimeter
wall. Behind it, red eyes glow through the dust. Then an
Elsecaller blinks into existence next to the debris, seemingly
from nowhere. With a flash of Stormlight, they solidify
the dust into stone, resealing the breach. It isn’t pretty,
but it’ll buy them time.
An Elsecaller turns her vision to the Cognitive Realm
while her inkspren partner keeps watch from her shoulder.
There, behind that wall, a deadeye! With a warning
shout to her comrades, she touches the wooden door and
transforms it into a brief cascade of water, then steps
through to capture the treacherous Shardbearer.
An Elsecaller squats with his back to the dawn,
balancing gracefully while using the light of the rising
sun to read a book on Azish military strategy. Quite
efficient, exercising the body and mind simultaneously._
Elsecallers have the strongest connection to the
Cognitive Realm of all the Radiant Orders. They use
the surges of Transformation and Transportation to
outwit and outmaneuver their enemies while turning
their surroundings into weapons. Transformation allows
an Elsecaller to converse with the Cognitive aspect of
objects, offering Stormlight and potentially convincing
them to become a different material. Meanwhile,
Transportation generates temporary personal perpen-
dicularities—passageways between the Physical and
Cognitive Realms—allowing the Elsecaller to peer into
and travel strategically through Shadesmar.

##### Elsecaller Philosophy

```
“I will reach my potential.”
Thoughtful, careful, and cautious, Elsecallers are
typically viewed as the wisest of the Radiants. For
them, the words of the First Ideal aren’t simply about
themselves, but about all people together. We should
all be encouraged to develop our strengths and address
our weaknesses, to make our journeys the best they can
be. As such, Elsecaller philosophy focuses on striving
and making progress. They want to reach their true
potential so the world around them can do the same.
See “Swearing Ideals” earlier in this chapter for more
details on the First Ideal.
```

###### The Second and Higher Ideals

```
Because each person’s journey toward their true
potential is unique, Elsecallers have no strict patterns
or themes for their Ideals beyond the First. And unlike
other orders, their Ideals aren’t oaths quite so much
as aspirations. An Elsecaller declares to their inkspren
how they wish to improve themself, then they set out
to achieve that growth.
Once you progress enough to satisfy your spren—
even if you improved in a different way than they
intended—declare what you have accomplished to
deepen your bond and achieve the Ideal. The partic-
ular type of improvement isn’t nearly so important as
constantly striving to improve, so each Ideal has Words
and steps unique to that individual.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the
Second/Third/Fourth Ideal,” consider the follow-
ing guidance:
```

### Elsecaller

###### Radiant Path

**148** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

◆ (^) Create a list of areas where you could improve
yourself—especially those related to your purpose
and obstacle. Consider whether any new areas have
emerged since the last Ideal you achieved. You might
want to improve a strength, mitigate a weakness,
train in an entirely new area, or something else.
◆ (^) Analyze your current situation or the greater journey
on which you find yourself. Which path of improve-
ment would be best for you to pursue at this stage?
◆ (^) Take steps toward that growth. Do you need to find
a mentor or master to teach you? The support of
friends or family? Specific tools or access to particular
facilities? You might already know what steps are
needed, or you might need to do more research.
◆ (^) Do the work: train with the master, learn from the
mentor, work with the support of those you trust,
make use of the tools and facilities, do the research.
You might achieve that growth to your inkspren’s
satisfaction—or along the way, you might improve
in a different but equally profound way.
For example, you could aspire to one of the
follow ing oaths:
◆ (^) _I will follow the path I set for myself, not the path
others expect me to take._
◆ (^) _I will cast light on my past missteps so I make
only new ones._
◆ (^) _I will leave behind what is comfortable in search
of untamed greatness._
For each Ideal beginning with the Second, your chosen
aspiration should be more difficult each time, requiring
more work and strenuous introspection (though any
self-improvement accepted by your inkspren partner
allows you progress toward your goal).
Over the course of your campaign, it’s likely your
needs and plans for improvement will change, so don’t
feel as though your original list for the Second Ideal is
immutable. Any earnest journey toward reaching your
true potential is valid for the Elsecaller Ideals.

##### Elsecaller History

```
In the days of the ancient Radiants, the Order of
Elsecallers had perhaps the most diverse membership
of any order, as they accepted all who genuinely desired
self-improvement. While the order had a significant con-
tingent of scholars, theologians, and leaders, Elsecallers
came from all walks of life. As a result, they also had the
greatest variety of duties: some served as liaisons to the
great ones among the spren, including Oathgate spren
and spren cultural leaders. Others served as Shadesmar
guides, military strategists, and logistical experts. Some
```

```
were appointed as keepers of the Honor’s Drop—a large
ruby so perfectly cut that it doesn’t leak any Stormlight—
and other perfect gems.
During the Desolations, in addition to strategizing
and transporting troops through Shadesmar, the
Elsecallers used the surge of Transformation to turn
stone and waste materials into food and water. As such,
Elsecallers were invaluable for maintaining armies
when supply lines were disrupted by the enemy. These
qualities earned the respect of Radiants and common
soldiers alike, and the order developed a reputation
for benevolence.
```

```
Chapter 5: Radiant Paths 149
```

STEVE PRESCOTT

```
In the modern day, though, only one Elsecaller is
known: scholar and Alethi royal Jasnah Kholin, bonded
to the inkspren Ivory. Thus far, no other inkspren have
sought a Nahel bond. During the Recreance, the mass
deaths of spren afflicted the already cautious inkspren
population with a deep fear of the mercurial nature of
physical beings.
In addition to being the Coalition of Monarchs’ only
Elsecaller, Jasnah is a master of the surge of Transform-
ation, but she’s only begun to explore the possibilities
of Transportation. The coalition would gladly welcome
new Elsecallers, and these could grow into strategically
important roles during the True Desolation, especially
if they’re skilled in Transportation.
```

##### Inkspren

```
To become an Elsecaller, you must first bond with
an inkspren.
```

###### Inkspren Appearance

```
In the Cognitive Realm, inkspren have similar features
to humans, though more angular, resembling an
incomplete statue rather than a living person. Their
forms are deep black, much like marble thinly coated in
shimmering oil, and their forms include black clothing
or armor (which is part of their essence).
In the Physical Realm, unlike other Radiant
spren, inkspren look exactly the same as they do in
the Cognitive Realm, though they have the ability to
change their size at will—from as large as a humanoid
to smaller than a grain of sand.
```

###### Inkspren Culture

```
Inkspren are known for their unemotional logic and
distinct manner of speech. They sometimes use verbs
in unusual ways, commonly using “is” (and other
forms of “to be”) to create efficient sentences—and in
the process, they often omit other parts of speech and
leave much implied. For example, instead of saying
“there is a spren present,” they might say “a spren is.”
Similarly, instead of “this is untrue,” an inkspren might
say “this thing is not.” Inkspren are similarly minimalist
with their body language, moving precisely as much as
needed to express their point, and no more.
Due to their extreme distrust of and hostility toward
humans since the Recreance, very little is known about
inkspren culture, such as whether they have their own
nation within Shadesmar. Even in the ancient days,
inkspren were known for their general aversion to risk;
after the mass spren casualties of the Recreance, the vast
majority of remaining inkspren viewed the Nahel bond
as a death sentence for any spren who forms one. Since
a bonded spren now dies if their Radiant forsakes their
```

```
Ideals, modern inkspren believe a bond is far too unsafe,
since both humans and singers have too irrational of
natures and change opinions too easily.
Some rumors tell of rare cases where inkspren killed
Radiants traveling through Shadesmar, believing
that this murder would save the bonded spren’s life.
However, inkspren are too cautious to act on their
emotions or make spur-of-the-moment decisions,
so if such murders indeed occurred, they were
meticulously planned.
```

###### Inkspren Names

```
Best described as humanoids made of black yet iri-
descent oil, inkspren naming conventions often evoke
colors and liquids, such as Drip, Ebony, Fluid, Graphite,
Indigo, Obsidian, Pigment, Sepia, Solute, and Viscosity.
```

###### Earning a Bond

```
Despite the overall censure of sapient physical entities in
inkspren culture, a small contingent of inkspren actively
seek bonds and wish to aid in the fight against Odium.
When searching for a prospective bond partner, these
inkspren value logic, caution, and honoring promises.
They respect people who objectively consider future
actions, and they distrust those who act on instinct or
emotion. While such analytical qualities are common
among scholars and religious adherents, they can
be found in nearly any
profession; for example,
a thoughtful soldier who
stops to assess a situation
before rushing into
melee would appeal
to an inkspren.

###### Fourth Ideal (Elsecaller)

```
Prerequisite: Level 13+; Speak the Third Ideal
Activation:
You seek to become a full Knight Radiant by speaking
the Fourth Ideal.

```

◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) You can call a swarm of logicspren as **_Radiant

##### Elsecaller Key Talent

```
When an Elsecaller completes their goal from the First
Ideal key talent, this unlocks access to the Inkspren
Bond talent tree (in this chapter) and the Transform-
ation and Transportation talent trees (in chapter 6).
```

###### First Ideal (Elsecaller Key)

```
Prerequisite: Level 2+
Activation:
```

_You begin bonding an inkspren, allowing you to breathe
in and use Stormlight. You might be aware of this nascent
bond, or you might use the powers subconsciously until you
get closer to speaking the First Ideal._
When you acquire this talent, you gain access to
Investiture, beginning with a maximum Investiture of
2 + your Awareness or Presence (whichever is higher).
You can now use the Breathe Stormlight, Enhance,
and Regenerate actions.
Additionally, you gain the goal “Speak the First
Ideal.” After you complete this goal, you gain the
following reward:

◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) You gain the Transformation and Transport-
ation surges.
◆ (^) You gain an additional skill on your character sheet
for the above surges, starting with 1 rank in each.
**Roleplaying an Inkspren**
The “Playing with Spren” section provides general
guidance on interacting with your spren. If you bond with
an inkspren, also consider the following.
**Perceivability.** Unlike many Radiant spren, inkspren
are visible and audible to other characters, so any spren
interaction has the chance of revealing their (and likely
your) position. However, inkspren can become almost
imperceptibly small in the Physical Realm, and their col-
oring makes them exceptional at blending into shadows,
so there’s little chance of them being spotted if they don’t
wish to be.
**Physical Interaction.** Inkspren are nearly incorporeal
in the Physical Realm. They can’t pass through objects,
but they can change their size to pass through even the
smallest gaps.
▷ **or** ↻ **Te s t Assistance (Costs 1 Focus).** Your spren
uses their knowledge and experiences to grant you an
advantage on a specific test. Typically, inkspren can help
you with Deduction, Discipline, and Stealth tests, along
with Lore tests related to topics they’re familiar with,
though your spren may be able to help in additional ways.

Recommended Heroic Paths for Lightweavers
The Lightweavers attract personalities of all types—from
the quiet and introspective to the gregarious and
outgoing—so long as they have an artistic spirit. The order
is also of particular interest to those with a penchant for
subterfuge. As such, the following heroic paths can be
excellent precursors to the Lightweaver Radiant path:
```

◆ (^) Agent (Investigator, Spy, or Thief)
◆ (^) Envoy (Diplomat)
◆ (^) Hunter (Assassin)
◆ (^) Leader (Politico)
◆ (^) Scholar (Strategist)

##### Lightweaver Philosophy

```
“I will speak my truth.”
Almost all Lightweavers are artists at heart, regardless
of their personal abilities. They view entertainment,
art, and beauty as vital, believing that survival means
nothing without also having something to live for. As
such, many Lightweavers give the impression of being
carefree, but this is far from the truth; their apparent
frivolity is intended to create laughter, joy, and catharsis.
Some Lightweavers were drawn to the order not by
art, but by their love of intrigue, secrets, and espionage.
Even those who prefer artistry still perform these clan-
destine duties when required, and this predisposes every
Lightweaver to deception. They constantly straddle the
line between reality and fiction, and it can be all too easy
to seek safety in lies. As such, a Lightweaver’s Ideals
aren’t about speaking oaths; they center on deep intro-
spection to find personal truth, along with readiness to
confront harsh personal realities. (See “Swearing Ideals”
earlier in this chapter for details on the First Ideal.)
```

###### The Second and Higher Ideals

```
For each Ideal beyond the First, you must speak an
uncomfortable and difficult truth about yourself, one
you must recognize and address to grow as a person.
Each Lightweaver must uncover the truth buried
beneath the lies they tell themself.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the
Second/Third/Fourth Ideal,” consider the follow-
ing guidance:
```

◆ (^) Construct a network of falsehoods. You could create
a complex false identity for a mission, concoct lies to
advance in a social group, or disguise aspects of your-
self that you don’t like to think about. Make the web
of lies large enough to potentially lose yourself in it.
◆ (^) Fall short or fail, letting yourself or your allies down
through your deceits.
_Surrounded by three opponents, a Lightweaver breathes out
Stormlight to create the image of a whitespine. His enemies
scoff—until the illusion’s spikes skewer one of them. The
Lightweaver turns the air behind his foes into a stone wall.
Now who’s cornered?
In the illusory guise of a pauper, a Lightweaver picks
up a handful of pebbles and transforms them into pebble-
shaped lumps of grain. She approaches a group of beggars
and offers the food for boiling into porridge, striking up a
friendly conversation and getting the latest gossip.
A Lightweaver stands on a stage, their trusty fiddle in
hand. As they play and tell their tale, their illusions depict
the scenes in exquisite detail. Coupled with the sound
effects provided by their Cryptic partner, the audience
is enraptured._
The Order of Lightweavers includes many painters,
musicians, sculptors, thespians, and practitioners of
similar arts. These Radiants create works of beauty to
boost the morale of their comrades and the common
people—but they also serve as the spies of the Knights
Radiant. Using the surge of Illumination to deceive
the senses and the surge of Transformation to alter
their surroundings, Lightweavers excel at clandestine
operations to gather information and sow confusion
in enemy ranks.
The resonance of this order’s surges affects each
Lightweaver’s senses and memory. For example, this
can bestow a unique way of experiencing light and color,
or it can grant the ability to perfectly recall images or
scenes as if captured in a photograph.

```
beauty. Other Lightweavers traveled Roshar, visiting the
towns most affected by the Desolations and working with
the other orders to rebuild homes. These Lightweavers
often recreated damaged cultural works or left new
pieces of their own creation, dedicated to offering beauty
and art in the lives of those who most needed it.
During wartime, however, Lightweavers were sent
on deep cover operations. Using Lightweavings, they
disguised themselves and infiltrated enemy strongholds.
These spies performed vital reconnaissance, stole battle
plans, sabotaged operations, fomented dissidence, and
engaged in many other acts of subterfuge and espionage.
Many other orders, especially the Skybreakers,
viewed the Lightweavers with some distrust—in part
due to the deception required by the Lightweavers’
activities, and also because the order doesn’t speak
oaths as part of their Ideals. Many wary Radiants
believed Lightweavers had loose morals, making them
liable to get lost in their own lies and defect to the
enemy. However, the Lightweavers had strong personal
values, and each argued they didn’t need to match the
stricter oaths the other orders required. As long as
each Lightweaver stayed true to themself, as required
by their Ideals, they were confident they’d remain true
to their allies as well.
```

◆ (^) Look inward. Acknowledge a misbelief you’ve allowed
yourself or an uncomfortable fact about your history.
Discoveries related to your obstacle or purpose are
excellent, but you can admit anything that grounds
you to your truth and allows you to grow.
For the Second Ideal, the truth you admit to yourself
can be a simple emotional one; for example, after
trying to convince herself she was fearless, Lightweaver
Shallan Davar simply admitted she was afraid. For the
Third and Fourth Ideal, though, you must plumb truly
uncomfortable truths. These can include confronting
traumatic experiences, examining parts of your identity
you’ve found difficult to accept, addressing ingrained
misbeliefs about yourself, or something else powerful
and painful enough to bring you crashing back from
fiction into reality. Generally, the truth for each further
Ideal should increase in magnitude, though any
admission accepted by your Cryptic partner allows you
to complete the goal.

##### Lightweaver History

```
In the era before the Recreance, the Lightweavers
were artists, entertainers, and spies. Many took it on
themselves to maintain the morale of the other Radiants,
creating performances, visual art, and other works of
```

```
Chapter 5: Radiant Paths 157
```

STEVE PRESCOTT

```
In the modern day, the Lightweavers consist of about
twenty Radiants in service of the Coalition of Mon-
archs at Urithiru, though their numbers are growing.
They were founded (in many ways unintentionally)
by a young sketch artist named Shallan Davar and her
bonded Cryptic, Pattern. Shallan began her journey
by seeking apprenticeship with the renowned scholar
Jasnah Kholin—but in reality, this was a scheme to
steal Jasnah’s Soulcaster and save Shallan’s failing noble
house. In the process, Shallan began seeing strange
figures on the edges of her vision and subconsciously
including them in her drawings. This led Shallan not
only into immense paranoia, but into bonding with one
of these spren, almost by accident. After several assas-
sination attempts on both herself and Jasnah, Shallan
found herself alone on a trek to the Shattered Plains.
During her journey, she instinctively used her Radiant
abilities to inspire others to be better versions of them-
selves; eventually, some of them became Lightweavers.
Shallan’s nascent Lightweavers perform much the
same role as did ancient ones, though in the war on
Odium, they focus on espionage and training in Surge-
binding. Shallan herself has led several infiltration teams
and conducted many individual clandestine operations.
```

##### Cryptics

```
To become a Lightweaver, you must bond with a
Cryptic. These are sometimes called “liespren,” though
the Cryptics themselves consider this term somewhat
pejorative and reductive.
```

###### Cryptic Appearance

```
Each Cryptic has a unique, three-dimensional pattern
of ever-shifting fractal patterns around a central point.
Most physical beings find it extremely difficult to
comprehend the totality of this complex movement,
yet can easily recognize the fractal of a Cryptic they’ve
met before.
Within the Cognitive Realm, this fractal is the
Cryptic’s head. It floats atop a tall, willowy body
ensconced in dark glassy robes with no folds or creases,
only sharp angles. The Cryptic’s robe is part of their
essence, and its planes and angles shift as the spren
moves. Their hands appear chiseled from obsidian or
pure white marble, yet their elongated, bony fingers
move as fluidly as skin and muscle.
In the Physical Realm, a Cryptic’s fractal is their
entire body, and it vibrates when they speak or hum.
They can press themself into surfaces to hide, but their
fractal remains slightly raised. As a result, they are easily
spotted unless they actively slow their fractal’s shifting
and hide on a heavily patterned surface.
```

###### Cryptic Culture

```
Cryptics are generally fascinated with “lies,” including
sarcasm, jokes, fiction, and anything else that isn’t the
literal truth. When someone speaks a particularly good
“lie,” Cryptics gather around them to appreciatively
hum “mmmm.” But ironically, Cryptics are quite inept
at constructing “lies” of their own, and they typically
speak in a highly literal manner.
The vast majority of Cryptics live in one of the largest
cities in Shadesmar; its name is an incomprehensibly
massive number that Cryptics can recite with ease,
but others can't hope to commit to memory. Because
of this, most people just refer to it as Number City.
Other Radiant spren distrust Cryptics, thinking their
mannerisms strange, pushy, and judgemental. However,
most Cryptics are content to passively learn and listen,
so they aren’t overly bothered by others’ opinions. This
Cryptic tendency toward inaction doesn’t mean they
don’t care about action; rather, they’re fond of planning
at length, then analyzing that plan extensively until it
can be refined no further. Once they make a decision,
they singularly commit to it.
Cryptics don’t represent untruths, but rather the
underlying mathematics and patterns that comprise
Roshar and the greater cosmere. As a result, the Cryptic
language is incredibly complex. They primarily speak
in raw data using a variety of rapid clicking sounds and
jagged tones in various frequencies. Because Cryptics
are so adept at code-breaking and analyzing patterns,
they can also speak many other languages of Roshar.

##### Lightweaver Key Talent

```
When a Lightweaver completes their goal from the First
Ideal key talent, this unlocks access to the Cryptic Bond
talent tree (in this chapter) and the Illumination and
Transformation talent trees (in chapter 6).
```

###### First Ideal (Lightweaver Key)

```
Prerequisite: Level 2+
Activation:
You begin bonding a Cryptic, allowing you to breathe in
and use Stormlight. You might be aware of this nascent
bond, or you might use the powers subconsciously until you
get closer to speaking the First Ideal.
When you acquire this talent, you gain access to
Invest iture, beginning with a maximum Investiture of
2 + your Awareness or Presence (whichever is higher).
You can now use the Breathe Stormlight, Enhance,
and Regenerate actions.
Additionally, you gain the goal “Speak the First
Ideal.” After you complete this goal, you gain the
following reward:
```

◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) You gain the Illumination and Transform-
ation surges.
◆ (^) You gain an additional skill on your character sheet
for the above surges, starting with 1 rank in each.

###### Cryptic Names

When a Cryptic’s complex name is translated to
another language, its meaning can almost always be
approximated as “Pattern.” When interacting with
other cultures, Cryptics take unique names inspired
by art or mathematics, such as Algorithm, Cipher,
Collage, Factorial, Integral, Radial, Symbol, Template,
Tessellation, and Variable.

###### Earning a Bond

Though some spren still generally distrust Cryptics,
many others trust Cryptic logic and decision-making
so completely that when the Cryptics were some of
the first spren to begin bonding humans again in the
modern era, the cultivationspren and several other spren
cultures quickly followed suit. Most Cryptics are quite
supportive of their fellows forming Nahel bonds, even
though they believe (due to the Recreance) that bonding
a human is a death sentence. They’ve decided the risks
are worth what they can gain from becoming Knights
Radiant again.
Unlike many spren, a Cryptic who seeks to bond
a human often doesn’t do so alone. Instead, these
Cryptics travel with a group of others to assess the
prospective Lightweaver, offer moral support, and study
the properties of a budding bond as it forms. They
tend to look for bonding qualifications such as aptitude
with falsehoods, sarcasm, and humor (which Cryptics
themselves tend to lack). They also appreciate artists
and other creatives who create well-constructed “lies,”
including fictional and imaginative works of art.

```
Roleplaying a Cryptic
The “Playing with Spren” section provides general guidance
on interacting with your spren. If you bond with a Cryptic,
also consider the following.
Language Deciphering. A Cryptic’s language-learning
abilities far surpass those of other spren. After your Cryptic
spends 10 minutes listening to a spoken language or 1 hour
deciphering a written one, they become permanently able to
use the spren Translation ability with that language, even if
it isn’t Rosharan.
Perceivability. Unlike many Radiant spren, Cryptics
are visible and audible to other characters, so any spren
interaction has the chance of revealing their (and likely
your) position. However, Cryptics are exceptionally adept at
mimicking sounds and voices, which can be used to generate
distractions and deceive others. This mimicry can be used
to embellish Lightweavings, as the Cryptic can perfectly
recreate the sounds of what they’re mimicking.
```

```
Physical Interaction. Cryptics are nearly incorporeal in
the Physical Realm. They can’t pass through objects, but
they can press themselves nearly flat against surfaces,
enabling them to pass through gaps that are at least half
an inch wide.
▷ or ↻ Te s t Assistance (Costs 1 Focus). Your spren uses
their knowledge and experiences to grant you an advantage
on a specific test. Typically, Cryptics can help with figuring
out patterns (including ciphers and codes), picking locks,
Deduction tests, and Lore tests related to topics they’re
familiar with, though your spren may be able to help in
additional ways.
Once you speak the Third Ideal, your Cryptic becomes
much better at detecting falsehoods, and you can use this
Test Assistance ability to gain an advantage on a test to
determine whether a character within your spren bond
range is lying.

order, appear in the Cryptic Bond talent tree for the
Lightweaver path.
```

###### Deepened Bond

```
Prerequisite: Speak the Third Ideal
Activation:
The strength of your Nahel bond now allows your spren to
manifest more fully in the Physical Realm.
Your spren bond range increases from 30 feet to 100 feet.
Additionally, when you spend focus to give your spren a
task, it costs you 1 fewer focus (to a minimum cost of 1).
```

###### Fourth Ideal (Lightweaver)

```
Prerequisite: Level 13+; Speak the Third Ideal
Activation:
You seek to become a full Knight Radiant by speaking the
Fourth Ideal.
You gain the goal “Speak the Fourth Ideal.” After you
complete this goal, you gain the following reward:
```

◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) You can call a swarm of creationspren as **_Radiant
Shardplate_** (see chapter 7).

###### Invested

```
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You learn to hold and wield greater quantities of Stormlight
within yourself.
When you acquire this talent, your maximum Invest-
iture increases by a number equal to your tier. When
your tier increases by 1, your maximum Investiture
does as well.
```

###### Physical Illusion

```
Prerequisite: Speak the Fourth Ideal; Wound Regen-
eration talent
Activation:
By mixing Transformation and Illumination, you create
illusions with weight and tangibility.
Spend 1 Investiture or more to use your Illumination
surge to infuse a physical illusion in thin air, following
the normal rules for either a simple or complex illusion.
However, unlike other illusions, this physical illusion
occupies its space as if it were real; objects can’t pass
through it, and if it’s Medium or larger, it can be used
as cover. This illusion weighs half as much as the real
version would (maximum of 25 pounds per surge
rank). Though it isn’t a character, it has health equal
to 5 × your ranks in Transformation, and each of its
defenses equals 10 + your Transformation modifier.
If the illusion is reduced to 0 health, its infusion ends
early and any infused Investiture is lost.
When you control your physical illusion, it can
interact with its environment (such as an illusionary
chicken flying into a windowpane). You can use to
task one of your physical illusions with something that
requires a test (such as attacking someone) or your
careful attention (such as writing a note).
When the illusion’s task requires a test, you must be
able to sense its target, and you use your Illumination
instead of that test’s usual skill. For example, if the
illusion is attacking with a real weapon, test your
Illumination but otherwise follow the normal rules
for that attack.
While wielding an illusionary weapon, the illusion
can make a melee attack against the Physical defense
of a target within its reach. This attack deals either
keen or impact damage depending on the illusionary
weapon, and the size of its damage dice increases
with your ranks in Transformation: at 2 ranks, roll
2d6 damage; at 3 ranks, roll 2d8 damage; and so on.
As usual, on a hit, add your Illumination modifier
to damage, and on a miss, you can spend 1 focus
to graze with that attack.
```

```
The other orders stand on ceremony,
tradition, or arcane systems of
laws and rights and organizations.
Lightweavers just get the job done
in whatever way’s best, beholden
to no one but themselves. And
they use art to do it.
```

**162** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

###### Second Ideal (Lightweaver)

```
Prerequisite: Level 4+; Speak the First Ideal
Activation:
You seek to deepen your Nahel bond with your Cryptic by
speaking the Second Ideal.
You gain the goal “Speak the Second Ideal.” After you
complete this goal, you gain the following reward:
```

◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) Your Enhance action becomes more powerful.
While you have 1 Investiture or more, you can use
Enhance as , and you don’t need to spend Invest-
iture to use this action or maintain its effect.

###### Take Squire (Lightweaver)

```
Prerequisite: Speak the Third Ideal
Activation:
You begin taking other people under your wing, allowing
them to breathe Stormlight and use surges before they’ve
established their own Nahel bond.
After a long rest, choose a companion or player char-
acter you can influence to take as your squire. To choose
them, they must be willing and sapient, you must have
known them for at least 1 game session, and they must
not have bonded a Radiant spren.
When you choose a squire, decide whether you want
to grant them both of your surges, one of them, or none.
That character becomes your squire, gaining
the surges you chose plus the other benefits in
the “Squires” section earlier in this chapter.
You can have a maximum number of squires
up to your current Ideal (such as three for the
Third Ideal). If you already have the maximum
number of squires, you must choose one to dismiss
as your squire before choosing a new one.
```

###### Third Ideal (Lightweaver)

```
Prerequisite: Level 8+, Speak the Second Ideal
Activation:
You seek to advance your Nahel bond even further
by speaking the Third Ideal.
You gain the goal “Speak the Third Ideal.”
After you complete this goal, you gain the
following reward:
```

◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) You can summon your spren as a **_Radiant Shard­
blade_** (see chapter 7).

###### Wound Regeneration

```
Prerequisite: Invested talent
Activation:
You can use Stormlight to rapidly recover from injuries.
When you use the Regenerate free action, you can
spend Investiture to instantly recover from an injury
of your choice (either instead of or in addition to
healing yourself ). Spend 2 Investiture to recover from
a temporary injury, or spend 3 Investiture to recover
from a permanent one.

##### Skybreaker Philosophy

```
“I will seek justice.”
The highest purpose of the Order of Skybreakers is to
ensure that the law serves everyone well, preventing
both tyranny and anarchy so that all have a fair chance
to live peaceful and happy lives. In particular, they
believe it’s their job to prevent the other Radiant orders
from abusing influence or Surgebinding power. To this
end, Skybreakers strive to change unjust laws, while
otherwise working within the law to serve the people—
often by exploiting loopholes in unfair laws.
Skybreaker Ideals focus on fighting for justice,
upholding codes, and protecting civilization. In the
modern era, the Ideals beyond the First typically follow
a rigid pattern; see “Swearing Ideals” earlier in this
chapter for details on the First Ideal. If you’re bonded
to an independent highspren that isn’t part of Nale’s
faction (see “Skybreaker History”), you can use the
patterns and common phrases below to inspire your
own oaths that are less rigid.
```

###### The Second Ideal

```
“I swear to seek justice, to let it guide me, until I find
a more perfect Ideal.”
This oath, known as the Ideal of Justice, is typically
sworn when a Skybreaker master—one who has spoken
the Fourth Ideal—accepts you as their squire. However,
this isn’t strictly required for those independent from
Nale. Either way, the oath represents that you’re in the
process of learning, and that you swear obedience to the
written code of law (as well as to your master, if you have
one). The Second Ideal requires you to learn firsthand
what laws serve the people and which do not—essential
preparation for the higher Ideals, which allow you to
choose which laws you follow and which you don’t.
```

```
A Skybreaker announces his presence at a residence as he
sends his highspren partner to invisibly scout the interior.
After waiting the requisite time with no response, he decays
the door into dust. The infractions within abound, from
improper facility maintenance to unlawful bondage and
mistreatment of captives. The Skybreaker notes each
infraction while freeing the prisoners, then begins his hunt
for the perpetrators.
Deserters stalk through the night toward a sleeping
merchant encampment. They’ve just unsheathed their
weapons when a cone of flame illuminates the landscape
around them. Skybreakers glide in its wake, surrounding
the bandits. The Radiants had been tracking this group for
days, and they finally caught the criminals in the act.
For months, the Skybreaker has been preparing her
case for an audience with the Prime Aqasix and his viziers,
studying laws and proceedings to write a faultless petition
essay. She now stands in the throne room of the Bronze
Palace, presenting arguments that back pay should be
granted to the formerly enslaved “parshmen” singers.
Skybreakers are justice incarnate, ensuring that power
is never abused and that order never devolves into
chaos. Though other Radiant orders see them as rigid
fanatics, Skybreakers typically use moral codes and legal
structures to fight for justice, protect civilization, and
champion vital causes. They are the bane of tyrants,
violent criminals, anarchists, and all who seek to
pervert the law and prey on the weak. With the surges
of Gravitation and Division, Skybreakers can bypass or
annihilate nearly any obstacle that hinders them from
delivering justice.
```

```
Recommended Heroic Paths for Skybreakers
Skybreakers are investigators, law enforcement officers,
attorneys, and litigators. Some focus on the physical
aspects of law enforcement, while others become experts
in the legal codes of nations throughout Roshar. As such,
the following heroic paths can be excellent precursors to
the Skybreaker Radiant path:
```

◆ (^) Agent (Investigator or Spy)
◆ (^) Envoy (Diplomat)
◆ (^) Hunter (Archer or Assassin)
◆ (^) Scholar (Strategist)
◆ (^) Warrior (Duelist)

### Skybreaker

###### Radiant Path

**164** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

```
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Second
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Demonstrate your willingness to follow the letter
of the law, especially when doing so is difficult or
conflicts with your obstacle. This could involve
following the legal codes of a nation you’re
operating in or traveling through, respecting the
rules of an organization or home you’re visiting,
or something similar.
◆ (^) Find a mentor (especially if you’re in Nale’s faction
of Skybreakers) who is willing to take you as an
apprentice. This could be a master Skybreaker or
someone else with a mastery of legal codes. Through
strict obedience, learn from them the art of working
through or around the law.

###### The Third Ideal

```
“I swear to follow...”
Known as the Ideal of Dedication, the Third Ideal
is an oath pledging yourself to a singular authority:
perhaps a code of conduct, a law, or even a specific
person. Highspren outside of Nale’s faction might even
accept you swearing to a criminal organization. This
Ideal demands that you follow the laws, orders, and
tenets of your chosen entity, even if their codes change
later on. While obedience is still a prominent element
of this Ideal, you gain some agency in which laws you
follow; you can ignore the rules of other entities and
nations who contradict or aren’t included in your pledge.
For example, the Skybreaker Szeth spoke this Ideal as
“... the will of Dalinar Kholin,” swearing himself to
the honorable king of Urithiru.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the
Third Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Continue following the letter of the law in
each place you travel. As you do, ruminate
on the tension of being forced to act
against your own interests by such codes,
especially where it concerns your obstacle.
◆ (^) Reflect on your experiences with your previous
Ideal: which laws and systems served all of their
peoples, and which only served the interests of
the powerful?
◆ (^) Find a code of tenets that most closely mirrors
your values and to which you feel you can pledge
obedience without overly compromising yourself.
This is often a fair and moral person (for example,
Nale’s faction chooses Nale himself ), a nation with
equitable laws, or an organization that shares your
principles.

###### The Fourth Ideal

```
Uniquely, you must speak the Fourth Ideal of the
Skybreakers before actually completing it. Though the
specific words of this Ideal of Crusade are individual-
ized for each Skybreaker, in swearing it, you pledge to
take on a personal quest with the permission of (or
in keeping with the tenets of ) your pledged entity.
You only become a Fourth Ideal Skybreaker after
succeeding to your highspren’s satisfaction. Your
quest must include rooting out an injustice
from a system; as a result, many Skybreakers
take decades to complete theirs, if ever.

```

STEVE PRESCOTT

```
are inflexible and merciless in their interpretation of
the law, and he has implemented a testing program
to determine the worthiness of hopefuls. Decades
ago, the Bondsmith Herald Ishar told Nale that the
return of the Radiants would hasten the return of the
Voidbringers; in response, Nale ordered the Skybreakers
on a crusade to either recruit or execute anyone they
could find with even a nascent spren bond.
The vast majority of modern Skybreakers are
part of Nale’s faction, which stands in contempt of
the refounded Knights Radiant at Urithiru. Nale’s
Skybreakers operate out of a Marabethian fortress
overlooking the Purelake. While traveling, they wear
the uniforms of local law enforcement (regardless of
their own ethnicity or nationality), eschewing clothing
or iconography that would identify them as Radiant.
After the True Desolation, Nale declared that the
singers were the original owners of Roshar—and thus,
that their law was the true law of the land—and he
allied his faction with the singers.
Szeth-son-Honor is the most prominent Skybreaker
who has defected from Nale’s command to join Dalinar
Kholin and the Coalition of Monarchs. There are
other defectors from Nale’s faction who would join
the refounded Knights Radiant or another party, and
some independent highspren could choose to bond a
prospective Radiant in defiance of Nale’s will.
```

##### Highspren

```
To become a Skybreaker, you must bond with a high-
spren, whether one of Nale’s or an independent spren.
```

###### Highspren Appearance

```
In the Cognitive Realm, highspren have a humanoid
shape—but that form appears as a void in reality
through which stars can be seen. This starscape
doesn’t move with the spren; instead, their movement
seems to pan across a night sky. Each highspren’s form
seems to outline clothing and hair, which move as if a
physical wind were blowing on their form. And despite
appearing to be holes in the universe, their bodies are
fully solid and can be touched. When viewed straight
on, highspren don’t have discernible facial features;
most people can recognize individuals only by their
silhouette and voice, though highspren can recognize
each other with no difficulty.
Within the Physical Realm, highspren usually appear
as black slits in the air, which they can expand to reveal
their starfield. They tend to be not much larger than a
foot in any dimension, and the air seems to warp around
them as they move.
```

```
For example, Szeth declared that his quest was to
“cleanse the Shin of their false leaders, so long as
Dalinar Kholin agrees.”
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Fourth
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Choose your quest: what lawful injustice have you
personally witnessed that needs to be excised from
its legal code? Both your highspren and your pledged
entity must agree this quest is worthy.
◆ (^) Acquire power or resources that enable you to
enact change within the relevant legal system.
For example, you might make allies in key positions,
gather necessary evidence or tools, or gain a position
of power within the flawed system.
◆ (^) Correct the systemic injustice to the satisfaction
of your highspren.

##### Skybreaker History

```
The Order of Skybreakers was founded to mimic the
abilities of the Honorblade of Nale, Herald of Justice.
Nale is a willful and uncompromising man who is
obsessed with law and order. He excels at adhering
to the exact written letter of the law of whatever land
he’s in ... and at finding and exploiting loopholes. He
once was more compassionate in his execution of the
law, but he has grown more rigid and merciless over
the millennia; in the modern day, he always seeks the
maximum penalty for offenders without any leniency.
In the ancient days of the Knights Radiant, the
Skybreakers served as military police and international
law enforcement, tasked with keeping the peace,
containing dark and dangerous forces, and monitoring
the other orders. The Skybreakers feared that Radiants
would think themselves above the law and become
tyrants, so they kept a vigilant watch for abuses of
Surgebinding. This caused frequent conflicts with other
orders, especially the Windrunners and Dustbringers,
with whom they had many moral disagreements. But
the ancient Skybreakers valued mercy regardless of
whether a criminal was Radiant; they understood that
the law isn’t perfect, and as they upheld it, they focused
on protecting the weak from the strong.
When the Recreance occurred, the Skybreakers were
the only Radiant order that didn’t forswear their oaths.
Instead, Nale clandestinely reclaimed his Honorblade
from Shinovar, bonded a highspren—becoming the
only known Herald to also become a Radiant—and
began directly leading the Skybreakers as a secret
police. For millennia, he has shaped the order in his
own increasingly extreme visage: his highspren only
bond the candidates he chooses, his Skybreakers
```

**166** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

```
Roleplaying a Highspren
The “Playing with Spren” section provides general
guidance on interacting with your spren. If you bond with
a highspren, also consider the following.
Perceivability. A highspren can make themself visible
and audible to whomever they wish; otherwise, highspren
in the Physical Realm are generally invisible and inaudible
to anyone (including other spren) without a specific ability
to perceive spren.
Unlike other spren, highspren can become invisible
even to their bonded Skybreaker. They can also read their
Radiant’s thoughts while within spren bond range, allowing
for completely silent communication between the two.
Physical Interaction. Highspren are nearly incorporeal
in the Physical Realm, but they don’t have the ability to
pass through objects. They lack malleable forms but are
mostly two-dimensional; as a result, they can't shrink
down, but can pass through very thin openings.
▷ or ↻ Te s t Assistance (Costs 1 Focus). Your spren
uses their knowledge and experiences to grant you an
advantage on a specific test. Typically, highspren can
help with investigating crimes and determining guilt or
innocent, Intimidation tests, and Lore tests related to
topics they’re familiar with, though your spren may be
able to help in additional ways.
```

###### Highspren Culture

```
Highspren inhabit isolated settlements in Shadesmar.
They don’t tend to live in close proximity to other
spren, who see them as fanatical, righteous, and strict.
Honorspren particularly dislike highspren.
Highspren culture idealizes obedience, order, and
following the law; many highspren have an encyclopedic
knowledge of legal codes from societies in both the
Cognitive and Physical Realms. Because of Nale’s own
dedication to the exact letter of law, many highspren
seem to worship him, or have at least pledged their
allegiance.
```

###### Highspren Names

```
Many highspren are reluctant to share their names with
non-highspren. Highspren names are numbers. Unlike
Cryptics, who often have complex equations as their
names, highspren names tend to be straightforward
numbers like 13294, 0–11, or 3405.
```

###### Earning a Bond

```
Historically, highspren looked for prospective Radiants
with a strong, unflinching moral code—even if it’s
a criminal code—or someone who believes in the
importance of societies having rules that govern
behavior. This could be an empathetic soul who tries
to change systems from within to better serve the weak,
a stout defender of the public that believes in protecting
the innocent, a moral warrior who wishes to punish
the guilty, or any other individual who believes in
true justice.
In the modern era, however, the majority of highspren
will bond only to an aspirant presented to them by Nale.
Even then, the hopeful must first pass trials and tests
proctored by existing Skybreaker masters. Promising
candidates tend to be disciplined individuals zealous
about peacekeeping, obedience, and the rule of law.
Nale’s faction of highspren don’t form a bond until
their Skybreaker speaks the Second Ideal; if you want to
play a current or former member of Nale’s Skybreakers,
see the “GM Tip: Skybreakers and Canon” sidebar in
the “Highspren Bond Talents” section.

```

```
GM Tip: Skybreakers and Canon
Within the Stormlight Archive books, Skybreakers who
serve Nale can’t even breathe in Stormlight upon speaking
the First Ideal, let alone use surges. (However, it’s possible
that independent Skybreakers who don’t follow Nale
might ignore these restrictions.)
If your group wishes to emulate this element of canon
in your own game, Nale’s Skybreakers gain their abilities
as follows:
Second Ideal Goal. Upon completing their “Speak the
Second Ideal” goal, a Skybreaker gains access to
Investiture and to the Breathe Stormlight, Enhance,
and Regenerate actions. They also gain the surge of
Gravitation and can choose its talents.
Third Ideal Goal. Upon completing their “Speak the Third
Ideal” goal, a Skybreaker gains the surge of Division
and can choose its talents.
To accomplish this delayed progression, replace the entire
First Ideal talent with the following.
First Ideal. When you acquire this talent, your maximum
health increases by 1 per level. This applies to all previous
and future levels; for example, if you choose this talent at
level 3, retroactively increase your maximum health by 3.
Additionally, you gain the goal “Speak the First Ideal.”
After you complete this goal, you become Empowered
until the end of that scene, and your maximum and
current focus increase by a number equal to your tier.
When your tier increases by 1, your maximum and current
focus do as well.
```

```
Chapter 5: Radiant Paths 171
```

##### Stoneward Philosophy

```
“I will be there when I’m needed.”
Stonewards often put the interests of others before
their own. Dependability is one of their core tenets,
and they strive to never let anyone down. Stonewards
help strangers in need, and they always make time to
support their friends—which sometimes leads to taking
on large projects that are more than they can handle.
They love to challenge themselves, approaching even
the most daunting situations with a can-do attitude.
To a Stoneward, teamwork is beloved, even sacred.
They nurture their social skills, learning to connect with
even the most abrasive of personalities. When working
with a group for extended periods, Stonewards typically
coordinate everyone to work together efficiently and
effectively, and after a job well done, they’re usually
generous with praise.
However, most Stonewards are also remarkably
stubborn. They don’t like to admit defeat, retreat, or
leave projects unfinished, and they’re almost always the
last to leave the battlefield or the work area. More than
any other order, Stonewards refuse to bend their oaths
for the sake of convenience, and many develop a habit
of self-sacrifice to live up to them.
Beyond the First Ideal (see “Swearing Ideals” earlier
in this chapter), each centers on humbly supporting
those in need and helping people achieve their dreams.
While each Stoneward expresses the Words in their own
way, they tend to follow certain patterns. The sections
below suggest common phrases you can use to inspire
your own oaths.
```

```
A Stoneward reaches one hand out to touch their ally’s shirt,
transforming it into a substance harder than diamond.
Meanwhile, their other hand scoops into softened stone and
flings a handful at an enemy. The ally’s hardened cloth
deflects the enemy’s blade just as the resolidified rock slams
into the enemy’s chest.
Backing into a canyon, a Stoneward removes her sash,
pulls it taut, and makes it stronger than tempered steel.
As her enemies enter the canyon, the Stoneward wills the
earth to seal behind her, then charges forth to crush her foes.
A Stoneward rushes toward the mess hall for a late
dinner. One thing after another has delayed him; he
stopped to hang a banner for a merchant, moved a couch
for an elderly couple, and held a large fabrial in place
while an artifabrian welded it. Food can wait when there
are people who need help! The mess hall finally enters
his sight—but with the approval and amusement of his
peakspren partner, the Stoneward diverts once more to
help a work crew unload boxes of provisions.
The Order of Stonewards are the heavy infantry of the
Knights Radiant, standing side by side with their allies
as an unflinching vanguard. With their two surges,
Cohesion and Tension, the entire environment is theirs
to wield. They can use Cohesion to sculpt stone and
earth, strategically blocking and slowing their enemies
while creating vantage points and cover for their allies.
With Tension, they can turn even the softest materials
into powerful weapons and armor. And their focus on
teamwork makes them an invaluable part of any unit.
```

```
Recommended Heroic Paths for Stonewards
Stonewards are known for their teamwork, dependability,
and love of a good challenge. People who enjoy sport,
martial arts, or wilderness exploration easily find them-
selves drawn to the Stonewards. As such, the following
heroic paths can be excellent precursors to the Stoneward
Radiant path:
```

◆ (^) Envoy (Mentor)
◆ (^) Hunter (Tracker)
◆ (^) Leader (Champion or Officer)
**Stoneward** ◆ (^) Warrior (Duelist, Shardbearer, or Soldier)

###### Radiant Path

**172** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

###### The Second Ideal

```
“I will step forward when others fall back.”
The Second Ideal, at its core, is about dependability,
about pushing through seemingly impossible odds that
others balk at. Instead of crumbling under the weight
of a challenge, you do everything in your power to
rise gleefully to the occasion. You don’t bend, break,
give up, or compromise; once you give your word, you
accomplish it or die trying. But even more importantly,
as a Stoneward, you commit to be where you’re needed
and do whatever’s required of you to support your
friends and allies.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Second
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Take on challenges and difficult tasks, especially
those that others have already refused.
◆ (^) Support your friends and allies in their moments
of doubt, weakness, or struggle.
◆ (^) Refuse to give up in the face of adversity. Through
improvisation, clever problem-solving, or sheer grit,
see yourself and those relying on you through.

###### The Third Ideal

```
“I will be the foundation on which others can build.”
In many ways, the Second Ideal is self-
aggrandizing, causing Stonewards to
compare themselves to others and strive
to come out on top. Meanwhile, the Third
Ideal requires you to recognize you’re only
one piece of a greater whole, and it’s your
duty to use the strength and dependability
you’ve cultivated to support all who need
you, not just a select few. Your aspirations should
always come second to the people you serve.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the
Third Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Provide aid to people who look like they’re
in need, especially if they’re too stubborn
to ask for it themselves.
◆ (^) Delay your own goals and other ambi-
tions—or even fail them—for the sake of
helping others achieve theirs.
◆ (^) Put yourself in danger for a cause that doesn’t
directly benefit you.

###### The Fourth Ideal

```
The previous two Ideals taught you to staunchly
embrace difficulty so you can overcome it, especially
in the service of others. However, this causes many
Stonewards to deny not only their personal desires,
but their essential needs. Though the specific words
are individualized for each Stoneward, the Fourth
Ideal recognizes that it’s impossible to consistently help
others if you don’t care for yourself. There’s a difference
between sacrificing your interests and sacrificing your
needs; this Ideal requires you to learn the difference.
You must both ask for and allow yourself to receive the
care you need, which allows you to continue serving
others without crumbling under your own expectations.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Fourth
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:

a prominent role, but they assist in the goals of the
modern Radiants at Urithiru. Their number includes
Dami, the Stormwall who fought in the war in Emul,
as well as the Iriali woman Zu and her peakspren
partner Ua’pam, who joined a diplomatic delegation
to the honorspren capital Lasting Integrity to entreat
the spren to bond more Windrunners.
```

##### Peakspren

```
To become a Stoneward, you must bond with a peak-
spren, the personification of mountains.
```

###### Peakspren Appearance

```
In the Cognitive Realm, peakspren are broad-
shouldered and tall, their height generally surpassing
seven feet. Each peakspren appears to be made of a single
rock, but across individuals, the colors and textures of
that stone have enormous variety. Some peakspren are
as smooth as polished marble, while others are rough
and porous as basalt. Each peakspren’s form is crossed
by a unique network of fissures, which often resemble
glyphs or other symbols. Their eyes, mouths, nostrils,
ear canals, and fissures give off a soft, molten glow,
though their skin is only slightly warm to the touch.
Like their appearance suggests, peakspren move heavily,
and their movements and voices both sound like grinding
stone. They can’t change shape and their clothing isn’t
part of their essence, so they typically import Unkalaki
garments and wear them the way the Unkalaki do.
While in the Physical Realm, peakspren appear as
miniature versions of themselves, only about a hand-
length tall. However, in the Physical Realm, they don’t
necessarily have fissures or facial features, nor do
they glow with molten light, making them look like
a humanoid figurine carved from rock.
```

###### Peakspren Culture

```
Peakspren culture has many parallels to the Unkalaki
of the Horneater Peaks, from the builds of their bodies
and their preferred fashions to their speech patterns
and mannerisms.
Like the Unkalaki, peakspren tend to be pacifistic
(though they remain non-judgmental if their bonded
Radiant disagrees). Peakspren avoid violence unless
absolutely necessary, and they place a much higher
value on providing and caring for family than they
do on martial prowess.
Peakspren culture isn’t centralized, and several
different tribes live throughout Shadesmar. Unlike
the monolithic tendencies of other spren cultures,
peakspren tribes have great variety in their opinions
and cultural values—and there’s quite a bit of rivalry
```

◆ (^) Work so hard on maintaining your Second and
Third Ideal oaths that you burn yourself out, such
as ignoring your needs so drastically that you collapse
or are nearly killed.
◆ (^) Engage in introspection: what needs have you ignored
in pursuit of others? Have you been eating and
resting properly? Have you maintained your support
system? Have you lost sight of the importance of
your own life?
◆ (^) Take steps to address your needs: go to the people
who care for you and discuss the needs you’ve been
ignoring. Make a plan with them to form healthier
habits that allow you to continue supporting others
without sacrificing your mental, emotional, and
physical health.
◆ (^) Allow yourself to rely on your support system.
When you take on too large of a project, allow
yourself to call on others. When you go into
battle in service of another, allow yourself to
ask for backup.

##### Stoneward History

```
During the Desolations, the Stonewards acted as elite
ground troops. They were renowned as the Radiants’
finest soldiers, though the Windrunners often contested
them for this title. Stonewards typically operated in
units made up entirely of their order, but they could
also be called on to lead units of non-Invested troops
or offer support to Radiants of other orders. They were
known to face down any odds with gleeful anticipation
and to never leave allies behind during a strategic
retreat. While Stonewards generally weren’t inventors
or creators, they had a reputation for improvisational
problem-solving; in even the most dire situations with
minimal resources, their presence could improve the
odds. This dependability earned them the respect
and appreciation of all the other orders—even the
Windrunners, their friendly rivals.
In times of peace between Desolations, many
Stonewards organized and participated in competitions,
especially sporting leagues and fighting tournaments.
Participation in these events was open to all, and
they generally drew crowds of spectators with betting
aplenty. Other Stonewards loved the outdoors and
embarked on expeditions to explore the less-charted
regions of Roshar. Still others preferred simply helping
communities, either traveling to find those in need or
staying at home to support their neighbors.
In the modern day, a small but growing number of
Stonewards fight in the war against Odium. Ever the
supporting players, none have yet gained fame or taken

```
between them. Some tribes find joy in the Radiants’
return, while others remain bitter about the Recreance
and hold nothing but scorn for the new knights and the
spren who bonded them; meanwhile, other tribes have
every possible opinion in between.
```

###### Peakspren Names

```
Unsurprisingly, peakspren naming conventions are
similar to those of the Unkalaki. Such names include
Autu, Hinlan’ai, Kun’ai’lam, Ku’tah’no, Lun’ha’ua,
Na’mi’ahu, Nua’lan, Tik’he’aku, Toam’ul, and
Una’tanu.
```

###### Bonding Preferences

```
When a peakspren seeks a prospective Radiant to bond,
they tend to value jovial and helpful individuals. Most
greatly enjoy conversation and friendly competition,
so they often look for gregarious or athletic people,
especially if the person enjoys being part of a close-
knit group.
```

##### Stoneward Key Talent

```
When a Stoneward completes their goal from the First
Ideal key talent, this unlocks access to the Peakspren
Bond talent tree (in this chapter) and the Cohesion and
Tension talent trees (in chapter 6).
```

###### First Ideal (Stoneward Key)

```
Prerequisite: Level 2+
Activation:
You begin bonding a peakspren, allowing you to breathe
in and use Stormlight. You might be aware of this nascent
bond, or you might use the powers subconsciously until you
get closer to speaking the First Ideal.
When you acquire this talent, you gain access to
Investiture, beginning with a maximum Investiture of
2 + your Awareness or Presence (whichever is higher).
You can now use the Breathe Stormlight, Enhance,
and Regenerate actions.
Additionally, you gain the goal “Speak the First
Ideal.” After you complete this goal, you gain the
following reward:
```

◆ (^) You become Empowered until the end of that scene.
◆ (^) You gain the Cohesion and Tension surges.
◆ (^) You gain an additional skill on your character sheet
for the above surges, starting with 1 rank in each.
**Roleplaying a Peakspren**
The “Playing with Spren” section provides general
guidance on interacting with your spren. If you bond with
a peakspren, also consider the following.
**Perceivability.** Unlike many Radiant spren, peakspren
are visible and audible to other characters, so any spren
interaction has the chance of revealing their (and likely
your) position. However, peakspren blend in well with
rocky environments, and they can hide within stone (see
“Physical Interaction” below), making them extremely
difficult to detect.
**Physical Interaction.** Peakspren are nearly incorporeal
in the Physical Realm. They can’t pass through most
materials, but they can move through and occupy stone
and other earthen materials as if in thin air. While within
stone, their sight, hearing, and ability to speak audibly
aren’t limited.
When a peakspren leaves their rocky hiding place, they
appear to be breaking out of the rock. The stone quickly
melds back together and becomes whole, leaving no trace
of the peakspren’s passage.
▷ **or** ↻ **Te s t Assistance (Costs 1 Focus).** Your spren
uses their knowledge and experiences to grant you an
advantage on a specific test. Typically, peakspren can help
with supporting or coordinating individuals (especially
unruly ones), Athletics tests, and Lore tests related to
topics they’re familiar with, though your spren may be able
to help in additional ways.

BEN MCSWEENEY & DARREN CALVERT
```

```
A stormform creeps through a back alley, hunting a fleeing
man—then vines burst from an illusory wall and pin the
Regal to the opposite building. A Truthwatcher follows the
branches from his disguised branching path, then he grins.
Works every time.
During the tense negotiation, the Truthwatcher has
stood back and allowed others to speak. But after the
highlord spits out yet another ignorant piece of drivel,
they’ve finally had enough. The Truthwatcher steps
forward and conjures an illusion of the magnificent leader
the highlord could’ve been if he were a better man. The
highlord’s voice quavers before falling silent, and the
Truthwatcher steps back to allow the talks to resume.
As the red crystalline form of her mistspren partner floats
above her head, an Enlightened Truthwatcher meditates
and attempts to send herself into a vision of the ancient
Radiants. If only she could discover the secrets of ancient
fabrial technology, it would revolutionize everything.
The cosmere contains countless secrets and mysteries.
Truthwatchers live to uncover and solve as many as
possible, acting as the researchers and investigative
reporters of the Knights Radiant. Their quest for
knowledge can take them almost anywhere, and their
surges of Progression and Illumination empower them
with illusions and plant structures as they explore
enemy strongholds or long-lost ruins. Meanwhile, the
power of Regrowth helps them survive the experience,
providing crucial healing for themselves and their allies.
A Truthwatcher with an Enlightened mistspren partner
can gain additional power from the Future Sight talent,
granting them visions of possible futures and even more
paths to discovery.
```

```
Recommended Heroic Paths for Truthwatchers
The Order of Truthwatchers attracts those who seek
truth wherever it can be found: artifabrians, scientists,
philosophers, journalists, and all manner of scholars
and thinkers. As such, the following heroic paths can be
excellent precursors to the Truthwatcher Radiant path:
```

◆ (^) Agent (Investigator or Thief)
◆ (^) Envoy (Diplomat or Faithful)
◆ (^) Scholar (Artifabrian, Strategist, or Surgeon)

### Truthwatcher

###### Radiant Path

**180** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

```
STEVE PRESCOTT
```

##### Truthwatcher Philosophy

_“I will seek truth.”_

```
At its core, the mission of the Truthwatchers is to
search for ultimate truths and share them. They believe
that knowledge belongs to everyone, and they refuse
to tolerate the misuse or malicious withholding of
information—especially when those in power are lying
to their people. However, the order isn’t a monolith,
and its members frequently disagree on what truths are
the most important, or even on the nature of “truth”
itself. Acknowledging that many truths are subjective,
Truthwatchers are open to changing their beliefs as they
learn new information. They generally greet differences
in opinion with excitement, and they often enjoy
engaging in spirited debates.
Beyond the First Ideal (see “Swearing Ideals” earlier
in this chapter), a Truthwatcher must actively pursue
discovery and spread what they learn, regardless of
what fields they specialize in or what beliefs they hold.
The Words are different for each Truthwatcher, but
they tend to follow certain patterns. The sections below
suggest common phrases you can use to inspire your
own oaths.
```

###### The Second Ideal

_“I will seek truth wherever it is hidden.”_

```
For knowledge to be shared, it must first be discovered.
The Second Ideal swears you to actively search for new
discoveries and answers to mysteries. You choose which
truths to seek, but success or failure in these pursuits
doesn’t matter. It only matters that you deliberately
seek to learn.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Second
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Dedicate yourself to discovery by deciding the truths
you wish to seek. Will you research a particular
academic field, a science, a religion, an ideology, or
the words and actions of those in power? You can
choose more than one, and you can change your
pursuits throughout the course of your journey
without risking your bond.
◆ (^) Identify an unanswered question, an unsolved
mystery, or an undiscovered innovation from one of
the types of truth you chose. With your mistspren’s
approval, begin to seek it.
◆ (^) Actively search until you discover what you seek—or
at the GM’s discretion, until you learn an unrelated
but significant truth.

###### The Third Ideal

```
“I will reveal truth to all who seek it.”
A core belief of the Truthwatchers is that knowledge
belongs to everyone; when you hoard secrets, you harm
the greater world. The Third Ideal obligates you to
share truth with anyone who would benefit from it.
Despite the broadness of the oath, you don’t need to
share everything you ever discovered with every person
you meet; this Ideal focuses on sharing knowledge that
has been deliberately withheld from those who would
most benefit, such as sharing proprietary agricultural
techniques with struggling farmers, or publicizing
fabrial technology previously kept secret by one
nation’s artifabrians.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Third
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Share truths you’ve discovered during your
adventures in a way that helps strangers. These are
generally people who are struggling greatly without
the knowledge or are in dire need of it. At your GM’s
discretion, you might even publish your discoveries in
writing, then ensure your written works are available
to those who need them.

###### The Fourth Ideal

```
Sharing delicate truths can have consequences,
especially for the person sharing and those they hold
dear. Since such consequences vary between individuals
and types of truth, each Truthwatcher’s Fourth Ideal
is unique. Regardless of the specific words, this oath
requires you to acknowledge the likely consequences of
sharing well-kept secrets and knowledge forbidden by
the powerful, and then to share those truths despite the
risks—no matter who might try to ignore or silence you,
and no matter what price you might pay.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Fourth
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Uncover a truth that others, especially those in
power, might kill to keep secret.
◆ (^) Confront your fears or biases about the consequences
of sharing the truth, especially in how they relate to
your obstacle.
◆ (^) Share the truth you discovered in a way that makes
it nearly impossible to make it secret again. You might
do so during a massive gathering, at a conference
of leaders from many nations or factions, or in a
published work spread across Roshar.
Chapter 5: Radiant Paths **181**

##### Truthwatcher History

```
In the days of the ancient Radiants, the Order of
Truthwatchers was known as the most scholarly and
quiet of the orders. Most Truthwatchers primarily
served as scientists, commonly researching the
nature and limits of Surgebinding, fabrials, and other
technologies. As a result, the order was celebrated for
many innovations. The ranks of the Truthwatchers
also included philosophers and other thinkers who
tended to get lost in their thoughts. While these
Radiants often seemed reserved in face-to-face
conversation, they excitedly explained and debated
their discoveries, especially in writing. Truthwatchers
published many manuscripts and spread them across
Roshar for interested parties to access.
A minority of Truthwatchers concerned themselves
with the actions of the powerful. These Radiants acted
like investigative reporters, loudly and forcefully voicing
their opinions if they discovered that a leader or other
powerful person was abusing their power or lying to
their people.
Thousands of years after the Recreance, only
a few Truthwatchers have appeared. Unlike the
Windrunners, Skybreakers, and Lightweavers, there’s
no central organization among Truthwatchers; they
are scattered and disparate individuals each finding
their own way. However, a society calling themselves
“Watchers of Pailiah” has formed to further the Herald
Pailiah’s interests; this organization is shrouded in
secrecy, but it has at least one actual Truthwatcher
among its agents. Of the Radiant Truthwatchers outside
this organization, several have aligned themselves with
the modern Radiants at Urithiru. A phenomenon has
emerged among them that differs greatly from the
ancient order: Enlightened Truthwatchers.
Enlightened Truthwatchers bond to mistspren that
became willingly corrupted by the Unmade Sja-anat.
This alters the spren’s appearance and the abilities
granted by their spren bond. These unusual powers
include future sight, which is believed to be related
to Odium and Voidbinding. Renarin Kholin and the
Enlightened mistspren Glys were the first known pair
of this new type of Radiant, and they’ve begun carefully
recruiting to bolster their number for the continued
war against Odium.
```

```
Enlightened Truthwatchers
With your GM’s permission, you might be able to bond with
a mistspren who has been Enlightened by Sja-anat. As an
Enlightened Truthwatcher, you begin having visions of the
past and future. When you bond this mistspren, you gain
the Future Sight key talent from the Enlightened talent
tree (see the end of this “Truthwatcher” entry). Later,
after you speak the First Ideal, you can choose additional
talents from this talent tree, in addition to the talents from
your Truthwatcher path.
As these Truthwatchers continue experimenting
with the surge, they usually become adept in Spiritual
Lightweaving, which excels in affecting hearts and minds.
When choosing Illumination talents, you’re encouraged to
select talents from the left side of the tree. These talents
include Distracting Illusion, Disorienting Flash, Spiritual
Illumination, and Painful Truth; you might also choose
Endless Illusions in addition to or instead of Painful Truth.
```

##### Mistspren

```
To become a Truthwatcher, you must bond with a
mistspren—but is your spren simply a mistspren, or
are they Enlightened?
```

###### Mistspren Appearance

```
Mistspren appear in the Cognitive Realm as a mass of
mist; though they can shape this as they please, they
generally prefer a humanoid shape. Atop the mist floats
a translucent crystal mask shaped like a human face,
which looks like solid porcelain until it catches the light.
A mistspren’s mask is part of their essence, but it’s the
only part they can’t shape to their will, and it doesn’t
move even when they speak. Despite a mistspren’s
diaphanous appearance, their body is completely solid,
and most mistspren wear clothing from the Physical
Realm that suits their occupation.
In the Physical Realm, mistspren look like shimmers
of light refracted through a prism onto a surface, and
each mistspren’s pattern is unique. These lights can
even appear floating midair and without a light source.
When mistspren hold still, plant-like structures of
light begin to grow atop them, then retract once the
mistspren begins to move. Though a mistspren can
alter the shape of their light shimmer, they’re each still
recognizable by the shape of the plant-like light that
grows from them.
```

**182** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

###### Mistspren Culture

```
Mistspren are known for their highly curious natures
and zest for novelty and adventure. They’re greatly
interested in learning how other people think and
looking at things from new and different perspectives.
They love adventure, and combined with their hard-
working and generally uncomplaining nature, this leads
many mistspren to be crewmembers on the ships that
sail the bead oceans of Shadesmar (particularly on
honorspren vessels).
```

###### Mistspren Names

```
Lovers of nature and beauty, and closer to
Cultivation than to Honor, many mistspren have
descriptive, poetic  names such as Adrift-in-Shade,
Constant-despite-Shifting, Flowing-and-Shapeless,
Hopeful-in-Measure, Temperance-through-Strife,
Truth-without-Bounds, and Weeping-though-Joyful.
```

###### Bonding Preferences

```
Most mistspren seem to view the prospect of bonding
a Radiant with general indifference. However, Enlight-
ened mistspren (described in the next section) all seem
to be actively seeking a Nahel bond. Enlightened or
not, when a mistspren seeks a bond, they tend to look
for people with unique or interesting perspectives
about the world, especially social outsiders. They’re
also attracted to people who spend a lot of time in
their own heads and who aren’t afraid to look at things
in different ways, such as philosophers, scientists,
and scholars.
```

###### Enlightened Mistspren

```
The Unmade Sja-anat has recently been experi-
menting with injecting Voidlight into various types
of spren, changing their appearance and properties.
Though she has freely experimented with the more
animal-like spren, she won’t experiment on sapient
spren without express consent. Mistspren, who welcome
new experiences, were the first Radiant spren to accept
Sja-anat’s offer.
While the word “corrupted” is sometimes used to
describe spren altered by Sja-anat, she and her altered
mistspren instead call these spren Enlightened. In
Shadesmar, the mist of an Enlightened mistspren’s body
is a deep ruby red, and their face mask is absent, leaving
in its place a swirling red void. In the Physical Realm,
they look like red crystalline structures that “drip”
light upward.
Mistspren who have been Enlightened seem to take
on new and simpler names such as Bryn, Goli, Kyhe,
Mele, Qima, Ruka, and Vlor.
```

```
Roleplaying a Mistspren
The “Playing with Spren” section provides general
guidance on interacting with your spren. If you bond with
a mistspren, also consider the following.
Perceivability. A mistspren can make themself visible
and audible to whomever they wish; otherwise, mistspren
in the Physical Realm are generally invisible and inaudible
to physical entities who don’t have a specific ability to
perceive spren.
If your mistspren is Enlightened, you can hold silent
telepathic conversations with them while they’re in your
spren bond range. If your mistspren isn’t Enlightened, you
must speak aloud to them (until you reach the Third Ideal
and manifest them as a Radiant Shardblade).
Physical Interaction. Mistspren are nearly incorporeal
in the Physical Realm. They can’t pass through objects, but
they can easily flow through even the smallest gaps.
Additionally, Enlightened mistspren can hide within the
body of non-sapient characters and remain within them.
If they do so with a cremling, the mistspren gains some
control of it; however, at the GM’s discretion, you may
need to spend some focus for the cremling to perform
complex tasks or act against its instincts.
or Te s t Assistance (Costs 1 Focus). Your spren
uses their knowledge and experiences to grant you an
advantage on a specific test. Typically, mistspren can
help with approaching and engaging in new experiences,
understanding others’ perspectives, Persuasion tests, and
Lore tests related to topics they’re familiar with, though
your spren may be able to help in additional ways.

##### Truthwatcher Key Talent

```
When a Truthwatcher completes their goal from
the First Ideal key talent, this unlocks access to the
Mistspren Bond talent tree (in this chapter) and the
Illumination and Progression talent trees (in chapter 6).
```

###### First Ideal (Truthwatcher Key)

```
Prerequisite: Level 2+

```

###### Take Squire (Truthwatcher)

```
Prerequisite: Speak the Third Ideal
Activation:
You begin taking other people under your wing, allowing
them to breathe Stormlight and use surges before they’ve
established their own Nahel bond.
After a long rest, choose a companion or player char-
acter you can influence to take as your squire. To choose
them, they must be willing and sapient, you must have
known them for at least 1 game session, and they must
not have bonded a Radiant spren.
When you choose a squire, decide whether you want
to grant them both of your surges, one of them, or none.
That character becomes your squire, gaining the surges

###### Wound Regeneration

```
Prerequisite: Invested talent
Activation:
You can use Stormlight to rapidly recover from injuries.
When you use the Regenerate free action, you can
spend Investiture to instantly recover from an injury
of your choice (either instead of or in addition to
healing yourself ). Spend 2 Investiture to recover from
a temporary injury, or spend 3 Investiture to recover
from a permanent one.
```

##### Enlightened Talents

```
If you bond an Enlightened mistspren (see the earlier
“Enlightened Mistspren” section), you gain the
Future Sight talent for free. This unlocks access to the
remaining talents in the Future Sight tree, which you
can choose as usual when you gain a level.
```

###### Future Sight (Enlightened Key)

```
Prerequisite: Bond an Enlightened mistspren
Activation:
As a Truthwatcher bonded to an Enlightened mistspren,
you have enigmatic visions of the future, which are initially
outside your control.
After a short or long rest or at the start of any scene,
you can ask the GM for a vision of the future. If the
GM deems an event in the near future to be important
enough to trigger a vision, you have a vision. Most
concern events within the next day, but events with
wider-reaching implications might be seen earlier than
that. At the GM’s discretion, they can have you make a
Deduction test to determine how much you can see and
understand; depending on the result, the GM might
tell you what the vision reveals about upcoming events,
or they might simply describe a jumbled vision with
confusing glimpses that don’t grant useful information.
The GM can spend C from this test to secretly and
randomly determine whether to give you true or false
information.
After you complete your goal to “Speak the First
Ideal,” you gain access to the later talents on this
talent tree.
```

###### Alter Fortune

```
Prerequisite: Glimpse the Future talent
Activation:
You use your glimpses of possibilities to control the outcome
of events.
Each time you finish a long rest, roll a number of d20s
equal to 1 + your tier, and record each result.
When an enemy or willing ally you can sense makes a
test, you can use a reaction to replace the test’s d20 roll
with one of your recorded numbers. You can replace
that number after you see their die roll and after they
apply any advantages, but you must do so before the
effects of the test are resolved.
You lose a recorded number after you use it to replace
a d20 roll or after a long rest.

On a successful test, you experience a vision of
10 minutes of the event as though you were there. If the
event is one you’ve experienced before, you can choose
to appear in a specific different location or time within
that event. You are a passive observer in the vision,
invisible, intangible, and otherwise unable to alter
the course of the event in any way.
```

###### Vision Void

```
Prerequisite: Glimpse the Future talent or Search
the Past talent
Activation:
Thanks to your ability to see the future and change its
course, you and your nearby allies create a black spot in
the future sight of others.
You and each ally within your spren bond range are
immune to any enemy effect that would reroll or replace
the result of any die rolled by you or those allies.
Additionally, if you’re present in or strongly
influencing an event, no enemy can ever see visions of
that event, whether they’re viewing it as a future event
or a past one.
```

###### Glimpse the Future

```
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal; Future Sight
key talent
Activation:
You have vague visions of future possibilities, giving you
some sway to divert your Fortune.
Once per round after you roll the dice for a test, you
can spend 1 Investiture or more to reroll that many
of the test’s dice. The original rolls have no effect and
you must use the new result.
```

###### Search the Past

```
Prerequisite: Speak the First Ideal; Future Sight
key talent
Activation:
You can attempt to direct your visions to see past events;
the further back you look, the harder they are to glimpse.
After a long rest, you can choose one past event you’ve
either heard about or experienced, then make a Lore
test. The DC is determined by how long ago the event
took place, as shown on the Past Sight DC table. This
DC is reduced by 10 if you’ve experienced the event
before, whether in person or through a vision.

SAMI RYTKÖNEN

##### Willshaper Philosophy

```
“I will seek freedom.”
At its core, the philosophy of the Willshapers is that all
people should be free, able to make their own choices
and follow any path in life. Many Willshapers facilitate
this with physical projects that support people from
all walks of life, often leading construction projects for
housing, irrigation, and infrastructure. However, some
Willshaper feel that the building and bolstering of hearts
and minds is even more important. These Radiants
often teach useful skills and trades that people can use
for both income and community improvement; they also
love to create safe spaces for people to radically express
and live as their truest selves.
Importantly, the Willshapers also facilitate
literal freedom, from liberating the imprisoned and
enslaved to aiding in campaigns against tyranny
and oppression. Wherever and however freedom is
sought, the Will shapers are there to offer tools and
support. They also know that when law gives way to
anarchy, tyrants inevitably emerge, so the Willshapers
advocate for new laws that prevent the strong from
oppressing the weak.
Beyond the First Ideal (see “Swearing Ideals” earlier
in this chapter), each leads the Willshaper toward not
only seeking freedom for those around them, but also
considering the nature of true freedom. While each Will-
shaper expresses the Words in their own way, they tend
to follow certain patterns. The sections below suggest
common phrases you can use to inspire your own oaths.
```

###### The Second Ideal

```
“I will seek freedom for those in bondage.”
During wartime, most captives are either prisoners
of war and or civilians held hostage within captured
settlements. But even in times of peace, freedom is
```

```
In a flash of light, a Willshaper appears in front of a
group of soldiers, palms on the ground at the enemies’ feet.
The stone beneath the squad becomes a quagmire, each
plunging to their waist before the ground resolidifies and
traps them. The Willshaper slips back into the Cognitive
Realm to prepare for the next contingent.
Shackled in a cell, prisoners cower at the sounds
of battle reverberating through the stone. Their chains
unexpectedly go slack; with mouths agape, the prisoners
watch the wall behind them melt like fresh crem.
Beyond it, they see a Willshaper humming while his
lightspren partner pulses, both to a reassuring rhythm.
The captives are free.
Tears in their eyes, a family watches their destroyed
house rise from the rubble. Its stone reassembles seemingly
of its own volition, emerging whole and undamaged.
The Willshaper steps away from the restored walls with
a smile on her lips; it’s an easy task when the stone
remembers well the home it’s supposed to be.
Willshapers embody freedom. This can be the freedom
of liberating the captive, but also the freedom of choice
and self-expression. They’re the builders and crafts-
people of the Knights Radiant, laying the foundations
of not only buildings, but of civilization. These Radiants
use the surge of Transportation to bypass physical
obstacles and travel using Shadesmar, and they use
Cohesion to soften the walls and chains that prevent
people from being free.
```

```
Recommended Heroic Paths for Willshapers
Willshapers are freedom fighters, teachers, and leaders
who all work in their own ways to free the oppressed and
create opportunities for others to express themselves.
Even before bonding lightspren, Willshapers are often
architects, crafters, and civil engineers. As such, the
following heroic paths can be excellent precursors to the
Willshaper Radiant path:
```

◆ (^) Envoy (Mentor)
◆ (^) Leader (Champion, Officer, or Politico)
◆ (^) Scholar (Artifabrian or Surgeon)
◆ (^) Warrior (Soldier)

### Willshaper

```
infringed throughout Roshar. The Second Ideal
obligates you to recognize oppression in all its
forms and help those suffering it how you can.
For example, most human cultures have engaged in
slavery, (especially the chattel slavery of singers), and
many cultures press criminals or those with debts into
indentured servitude. Beyond this, many forms of
systemic oppression exist, from Vorinism’s caste system
and rigid gender roles to the destitution and poverty
throughout most nations. These injustices reduce
people’s freedom to express themselves and walk the
life paths they want.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Second
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Free people from literal captivity.
◆ (^) Give people the tools or training to make
their ow n way.
◆ (^) Help a companion feel the freedom and safety to
express their true identity.

###### The Third Ideal

```
“I will fight oppression...”
Each Willshaper finishes this oath in their own way.
For one, it could end “... even if that oppression comes
from within.” For another, it may be “... even against
the tyranny of the leaders I serve.” Your Third Ideal
depends on your journey and the challenges you face,
especially related to seeking freedom for yourself and
others despite your flaws, biases, and obstacles. This
Ideal requires you to expand your search for oppression
beyond the individual to identify its sources.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Third
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Think back on the people you helped as part of
earning the Second Ideal, as well as the forms of
personal or cultural oppression you’ve witnessed
or experienced. What root cause prevented
freedom or self-expression in those cases?
◆ (^) Ponder whether you’ve been complicit, intention-
ally or not, with any forms of oppression. Are you
associated with the root cause? Have you held
yourself or others to the oppressor’s standards?
◆ (^) Choose a form of oppression from your list—ideally
one you learned you were complicit in—and work
to end it. You might seek to change laws, start a
cultural moment, or help someone with similar goals
who’s in a better position to achieve the change.
You must either succeed, or in your pursuit instead
create other widespread freedoms that satisfy your
lightspren partner.
_They don’t just talk about freedom,
they work for it, and they build
systems and structures that enable
freedom for everyone._

###### The Fourth Ideal

```
Liberating people and giving them options to pursue
what they want in life is an exhilarating and fulfilling
endeavor. It can be easy to center such actions on
yourself, attaining that high and moving on to the next.
The Fourth Ideal’s specific words are individualized
for each Willshaper, but it requires you to instead focus
on the people you’re helping: have you made a lasting
difference in their lives? Are those people truly free, or
did they gain but a glimpse before again succumbing to
the clutches of oppression? To stay free, people need the
ability to maintain their own freedom.
As you work toward milestones to “Speak the Fourth
Ideal,” consider the following guidance:
```

◆ (^) Consult the list of people you freed while working
toward the Second Ideal, along with people you
helped while working toward the Third. Find out
where they are now and check in with them: are they
still living in freedom, or are they again suffering
oppression? Either way, ask what they want or need to
live happily as their truest selves. Do your best to help
them gain this.

##### Willshaper History

```
The ancient Willshapers traveled throughout Roshar to
aid settlements. Some constructed buildings and infra-
structure, while others taught skills and other essential
trades that offer everyone more freedom to live as they
choose, such as sanitation and metalworking. Many
Willshapers chose to aid campaigns to depose tyrants,
change oppressive laws, and liberate the enslaved and
incarcerated.
Due to the order’s philosophy of facilitating radical
self-expression, these Radiants were far from uniform.
Some were flamboyant, gregarious, and loved daring
fashions, while others were much more subdued
and dressed conservatively. However they presented
themselves, Willshapers all celebrated and encouraged
each other’s forms of expression, since they believed
that freedom to follow their own path was the most
important thing.
However, many other Radiant orders perceived this
lack of uniformity as erraticism and unreliability. To
them, the Willshapers were capricious, more concerned
with novelty and oddity than serving as a military force.
Meanwhile, supporters of the order observed the posi-
tive change Willshapers facilitated, and understood that
their seeming frivolity never interfered with their duties.
During the Desolations, the Willshapers’ main
responsibility was to reinforce fortifications in anticipa-
tion of an attack and to rebuild following one. In battle,
```

```
many could create sudden and impromptu battlements,
reshaping the battlefield for their allies.
With the return of the Knights Radiant, Willshapers
have been one of the most elusive orders. Lightspren feel
deeply betrayed by the humans who enslaved singers for
millennia, so these spren have largely rejected humans
as potential Willshapers. Instead, the lightspren have
sought singers. The lightspren Timbre started to bond
the listener heroine Eshonai before her death in the War
of Reckoning; afterward, Timbre sought a bond with
Eshonai’s sister Venli. Through this bond, Venli has
overcome the influence of a bonded Voidspren, defecting
from Odium’s forces and returning to the Shattered
Plains. There, with the permission of the lightspren,
Venli now offers Radiance to other surviving listeners.
```

##### Lightspren

```
To become a Willshaper, you must bond with a lights-
pren (also known as a Reacher).
```

###### Lightspren Appearance

```
In the Cognitive Realm, Reachers look much like
humans cast in bronze. Though statue-like, their body
moves as smoothly and easily as would flesh and hair.
Each lightspren’s bronze skin has a unique pattern of
grooves. The pupils of their eyes are the only gaps in
their body’s exterior; these small holes dilate much like
those of humans. Reachers can’t change their appear-
ance, and they typically don clothing of human make,
though they don’t often wear it the way the culture of
origin would.
Within the Physical Realm, lightspren are balls of
light, warm and silky to the touch. Both their tempera-
ture and brightness fluctuate with their mood, from
subtle while relaxed to bright and feverish in moments
of high emotion. As they move, a comet-like tail follows
behind, then quickly catches up when they stop.
```

```

**192** Chapter 5: Radiant Paths

```
KEVIN O’NEILL
```

###### Lightspren Culture

Reachers are characterized by their love of travel and
adventure, as well as their seeming taciturnity. While
they can speak humanoid languages, lightspren have a
greater alignment to the rhythms of Roshar than other
spren, and they prefer to communicate via rhythmic
pulses. Anyone can understand this form of speech with
enough exposure, but it’s especially intuitive to singers,
who are also attuned to the rhythms.

```
Roleplaying a Lightspren
The “Playing with Spren” section provides general
guidance on interacting with your spren. If you bond with
a lightspren, also consider the following.
Perceivability. Unlike many Radiant spren, lightspren
are visible and audible to other characters, so any spren
interaction has the chance of revealing their (and likely
your) position. However, lightspren can move exceptionally
fast through the air, and they can read their Radiant’s
thoughts within spren bond range, significantly reducing
the risk of detection.
Physical Interaction. Lightspren are mostly insubstan-
tial in the Physical Realm, but they have more substance
than most spren. Lightspren can’t pass through objects—
and they can even interact with lightweight objects using
their Push Object ability, despite not having hands or the
ability to change their form.
Push Object (Costs 2 Focus). Your lightspren slowly
pushes an unattended, unsecured object that weighs no
more than 0.1 pounds (but they aren’t strong enough to
carry it). This movement must begin and end in your spren
bond range. If your spren is trying to do so undetected, the
GM might ask you to make a Stealth test against a DC they
set.
Rhythmic Communication (Costs 1 Focus) : You’ve
taught yourself to interpret your lightspren’s pulses. While
within spren bond range, you can have your spren send
you a silent message up to 25 words long. Additionally,
after you’ve known an ally for at least 5 days, you can teach
them to interpret your spren’s pulses, and the spren can
communicate with them in the same way (but the ally can’t
respond silently).
or Te s t Assistance (Costs 1 Focus). Your spren
uses their knowledge and experiences to grant you an
advantage on a specific test. Typically, lightspren can help
with tests related to travel and fair trade, Survival tests,
and Lore tests related to topics they’re familiar with,
though your spren may be able to help in additional ways.
```

```
Reachers are ubiquitous among Shadesmar’s cities
and bead sea vessels, and many work as sailors, dock-
workers, guides, currency exchangers, and merchants
(including offworld imports). They are known for
generally being helpful and polite. The floor and decks
on which Reachers work are typically strewn with
sound-conducting copper lines. The lightspren walk on
these lines with bare feet, allowing near-instantaneous
vibrational communication with each other.
```

###### Lightspren Names

```
Because of their rhythmic form of communication, when
lightspren deal with humans or other spren, many use
names inspired by music, such as Aria, Beat, Cadence,
Chime, Hymn, Lyric, Pitch, Tempo, Trill, and Vibrato.
```

###### Earning a Bond

```
When a Reacher seeks a prospective Radiant, they first
look for kindness and empathy. Does the person have
the patience and understanding to meet others where
they are and facilitate communication despite barriers?
Lightspren also appreciate people who seek freedom
for themselves and others. They have no tolerance for
and refuse to bond bullies or anyone who has willingly
oppressed others. For a human to bond a lightspren,
the human must demonstrate a commitment to freedom
and a rejection of slavery in all its forms.
```

##### Willshaper Key Talent

```
When a Willshaper completes their goal from the First
Ideal key talent, this unlocks access to the Lightspren
Bond talent tree (in this chapter) and the Cohesion and
Transportation talent trees (in chapter 6).
